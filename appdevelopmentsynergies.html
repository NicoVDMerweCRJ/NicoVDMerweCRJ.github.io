					<h2><u>Week 1</u></h2>
					<h3><li>The Unreal Engine and ARCore</li></h3>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="App Development Synergies/Week 1/Images/UnrealLogo.jpg" alt="" /></span>My research into my project idea posted for week 1 was centred around the Unreal Engine and how to integrate AR Core features in an application. I found a QuickStart guide to ARCore at <a href="https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/unreal/quickstart"> Unreal Quickstart</a> and followed the guide lines provided by Goolge and the team at Unreal.</p>							
					<p>My findings where that it was simple to set up the Plugin inside the unreal environment and load a template to play around with and deploy to my testing device. The setup for mobile inside Unreal was a straightforward setup and deployment to mobile was easy and quick.</p>
					<p>There have been huge improvements in deployment times in the last two releases of the unreal engine. Packaging and deployment have been a huge focus for Epic following the success of Fortnite on mobile and they have started integrating the technology used to optimize and deploy for mobile into the engine and huge feature updates and improvements on mobile is showing.</p>							
					<p>I choose to run the application on Vulkan due to the strides made in frame rates and rendering by the open source 3D graphics and computing API. I tried to run my AR core with Vulkan and hit my first barrier in my application design. Vulkan does not support AR rendering as of yet.</p>								
					<p>I’m am going to use the ASTC 3.1 format to compress my content as it does the highest quality compression and retains a lot of the quality while doing so. I refreshed my memory on the basics of unreal mobile development and different compression strategies for my files by viewing a live stream that Unreal hosted: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRhjTD7FIuI"> Unreal Stream</a> </p>
					<p>I really appreciated how this week’s exercise has made me think a bit outside of what I usually do. It was challenging and getting the blog up and running on github pages was also a great experience in setting up and I see the value of git hub beyond just hosting code repositories, but seeing the potential of hosting a blog or examples of work done on a domain of your choice. </p>							
					<p>I found out that Mobile has a limit of 75 on Unreal Engine 4 deployment as confirmed in the forums located at: <a href="https://answers.unrealengine.com/questions/482412/want-to-increase-bone-limit-on-mobile-more-than-75.html"> answers.unrealengine.com</a>. It can be increased apparently, but then older devices might not recognize the structure and fail to display the character at all.</p>
											
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="App Development Synergies/Week 1/Images/ARCore.png" alt="" /></span>I will use the Unreal 4.22 engine to design the application and utilize blueprint and C++ for development. I choose Android (26 – Oreo and up) as my platform of choice for this project as it supports Vulkan and Google ARcore which are two core plugins/tools I plan to use. My compiler will be Visual Studio 2018 and all code will be compiled from source code of the Unreal Engine as it will be required during plugin integration.</p>
					<p>I want to integrate AR into the application and provide a feature where the user can place the fish tank on any surface in a real-world location and then interact with your fish. I will implement this feature using Google ARcore technology that comes as a plugin with the Unreal Engine.</p>
					<p>Assets needed are created using a combination of Blender and GIMP. Both Blender and gimp are free to use open source and will cover all my animation, modelling and texturing needs for my assets. I will be using only a few assets at first as the focus will be on interaction and AR rather then content at the start of development. 
					<p>Animation will be physics driven for some objects so only basic rigging and bone structures will be required. The two fish will need to be rigged and skinned for animation and a bone structure of 15 bones will be used. Mobile has a limit of 75 on Unreal Engine 4 deployment, but this should not be a issue as assets won’t benefit from a complex one structure for animation.
					<p>Textures will be 2k resolution and all materials are developed in Unreal Engine using the material editor and blueprinting.</p>

					<p></p>
				
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="App Development Synergies/Week 1/Images/UIMainMenuDesignFlowChart.jpg" alt="" /></span>I have an idea for an application to that I feel fits into the theme of ”As long as we have each other, we will never run out of problems”.</p>	
					<p>The application will tell the story of two fish living together in a fish tank. You have control of one fish called Bob and need to stay alive for as long as you can while challenges arise throughout your day. The entire application takes place in one fish tank so minimal assets are required. The focus will be on your interactions with the fish your control.</p>	
					<p>During the day Steve will be a burden and at night an ally. I wanted to tie the application into the theme “As long as we have each other, we will never run out of problems” by showing how two fish live in a tank. I found the inspiration for my design after staring at my fish tank I have at home. I have 3 fish in the tank and they always fight during the day but huddle up at night. As much as they have one another and need each other to survive, they will always have problems.</p>	 
					<p>I really appreciated how this week’s exercise has made me think a bit outside of what I usually do. It was challenging and getting the blog up and running on github pages was also a great experience in setting up and I see the value of git hub beyond just hosting code repositories, but seeing the potential of hosting a blog or examples of work done on a domain of your choice.</p>

					<h2><u>Week 2</u></h2>
					<h3><li>UE4 and mobile development</li></h3>			
					<p>Unreal and its mobile development environment has made very big strides the past few years. After the release of Fortnite we saw the release of Unreal Engine 4.20 which brought with it over 100 mobile optimizations tools as well as the ability to optimize gameplay across platforms as stated by Tim Slager [reference] T.S. 2018. Exploring Unreal Engine 420’s Mobile Optimizations. August 27. Exploring Unreal Engine 420’s Mobile Optimizations. [Online]. [10 June 2019]. Available from: <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/tech-blog/exploring-unreal-engine-4-20-s-mobile-optimizations">www.unrealengine.com/en-US/tech-blog/exploring-unreal-engine-4-20-s-mobile-optimizations</a></p>
					<p>The blog also includes a Unreal Live Training stream that discuss the numerous optimizations, features and stability improvements the Unreal team has made to the engine and mobile platforms supported while also highlighting how Epic leveraged these tools to ship Fortnite on iOS and Android and overcome technical challenges such as memory, performance and battery life for the application.</p>
					
					<h3><li>Repositories</li></h3>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="App Development Synergies/Week 2/Images/perforce-logo.png" alt="" /></span>When researching into repositories I was looking for a solution that can integrate well into the Unreal Engine and handle big file transfers like textures and .fbx that will be included in my project. The two that stood out where GitHub and Perforce.</p>
					<p>GitHub and perforce have many differences that set them apart from one another.</p>
					<p>GitHub has a distributed Git model which allows developers to download the source code along with a full version history to their local machine where they can make commits, diffs and merge code fast. Each developer has their own copy of the repository which can be a security risk at big developer companies and make it hard to manage the application data. Typically, the repositories security levels of the project are assigned at a repo level to employees and the projects are broken into several different branches where teams end up dealing with cross repository dependencies that could be a nightmare if not controlled correctly.</p>
					<p>Perforce Is Centralized has a centralized model that centres around storing everything in one place ensuring developers always have the latest version. All commits from developers, no matter where they sit across the world are done to the same server where the project is located. This provides improved auditability, traceability and communication because checked out work is easily visible to other developers on the team [Reference] Perforce, P. 2019. Git vs Perforce. April 11. How to Choose. [Online]. [12 June 2019]. Available from: <a href="https://www.perforce.com/blog/vcs/git-vs-perforce-how-choose-and-when-use-both">www.perforce.com/blog/vcs/git-vs-perforce-how-choose-and-when-use-both</a></p>
				
					<h3><li>AR Images and Objects</li></h3>
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="App Development Synergies/Week 2/Images/ARImage.jpeg" alt=""/></span>I was researching deeper into AR this week and wanted to integrate Augmented images and objects into the application as well. I found that it is possible with Google ARCore and Unreal engine and is quite simple to do as well. Unreal can take images the user loaded into the engine and turn them into smart images the camera will recognize, and actions can be executed on recognition of the images. This gives me the ability to make something interesting in that I would be able to create a companion application with the original that would recognize images and cards that could be used as bonus content or power ups by the user. I found documentation on Augmented Images and how to integrate the feature into Unreal Engine at [Reference] Arcore, G.A. 2019. Augmented Images developer guide for Unreal. February 28. Using Augmented Images. [Online]. [13 June 2019]. Available from: <a href="https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/unreal/augmented-images/guide">https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/unreal/augmented-images/guide</a></p>
								
					<p>Setting up the environment using Unreal and Android works was quick and easy as all SDK downloads required were included with the engine inside the installation directory Epic Games\UE_4.22\Engine\Extras\AndroidWorks.  I continued to get a project template for AR up and running and did my first build for Android mobile on a Galaxy S7 Edge and it worked perfectly without any issues.</p>
					<p>I have also continued to build out a basic fish tank and got it placed on a flat surface and had the AR track the object and its location. This was simple to execute with Unreal Engine 4.22 and can see the strides they have made when it comes to mobile development.</p> 
					<p>I decided to load in one image a painting into the art application and see if I could convert it into an Augmented Image. It too wasn’t complicated, and the image was recognized as soon as it came into view of the camera on my mobile device.</p> 
					<p>My development environment is now set up with AR functioning as intended and Unreal deploying to mobile successfully. I am starting on my basic prototype of the application and creating assets and basic blueprint functionality that would provide the base of my application. I have uploaded my project to my git repository as source control with GitHub is integrated and working with Unreal Engine as well.</p>
				
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="App Development Synergies/Week 2/Images/wayfare-arcore-810x529.png" alt="" /></span>I started setting up my development environments and SDK’s to start working on a prototype of the application I want to build. Using the Unreal Engine and developing for mobile Android specifically, I needed to setup the SDK’s and configure my environment inside Unreal engine to be mobile ready and have my repositories linked to my GitHub account.</p>
					<p>A big discussion the past week was Platform and Tools. What will be used and why? I have decided to stick to the Unreal Engine and Mobile Android development using ARCore from google. 
					<p>The other topic that came up the past week was Unity vs Unreal. Which engine is the one to use for the project going forward? I have worked on Unity for many years before and work with Unreal Engine atm in my professional career. This has given me a unique outlook on the engines and how they compare with one another.</p>
					<p>I have chosen to build my application on the Unreal Engine due to the numerous new tools and advancements made in the mobile space. Unity has been the go-to engine for mobile the past few years and has an amazing workflow but can sometimes lack when it comes to quality of light used in scenes/levels. I want to build my knowledge of Unreal and use this small application to test and integrate as many of their new features released especially around AR and mobile deployment.</p>

					<h2><u>Week 3: App Jam</u></h2>			
					<h3><li>TRAPPED!</li></h3>
					<p></p>	
					<div align="center"><iframe width="760" height="515" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SsUUyYhOU6U" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
					<p></p>
					<p>I wanted to build a maze puzzle game using match two game mechanics that will open doors in the maze for a certain amount of time before closing again and restarting the puzzle. The theme of the App Jam was Guide Opponent Restricted. I added a map of the maze on the walls that act as a guide for the player. That's if they can figure out where they are. The maze is the opponent</p>
					<p>I used the Unity Engine to build my application due to the engine’s ability to rapid prototype. I was going to use the prefab feature to build out levels rapidly from basic assets created using Blender for models and GIMP for my textures. I build the game to run on the Samsung Gear VR using Android API-26 Oreo and a Samsung Galaxy s7 Edge and utilizing the Oculus SDK included inside Unity.</p>
					<p>Before I jumped right in and started building the application, I wanted to make sure I time myself and keep an eye on the 42-hour limit of the App Jam. I used the Harvest tool to time my work. It was recommended in last week’s Webinar session by Matthew Wright and it made the process of timing my project very easy. I created a project for the app jam started and stopped the timer as I worked the past week. Everything runs in my browser and there is a free trail available that gives small projects the ability to track time.</p>
				
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="App Development Synergies/Week 3/Images/UnityLogo.png" alt=""></span>I started my design on paint, drawing out the map and objects I wanted to place in the maze. I started with 6 different objects, but when down to 4 quickly due to the time constraint on the App Jam. I wanted to make the halls of the maze look very similar and the doors hidden in the walls too make it harder to solve. I used the MainMenu Kit included with Unity to get a basic UI up and going and give the user a way to restart the map if needed or quite to main menu.</p>	
					<p>I made nine game objects in the end to use in Unity's prefab system and started building different combinations of pieces to place together and form a maze. I utilized C# as my scripting language and VS code as my compiler for Unity. Coding the project went well. Getting done what I needed to was easy as loads of documentation on Unity C# programming is available online. Creating my animations inside unity and using mechanism made my few animations I needed easy to create as I made sure during the asset creation process that my pivots were set correctly.</p>	

					<p><span class="image right"><img src="App Development Synergies/Week 3/Images/Screenshot2.png" alt=""></span>During the development I picked up area’s where I could approve on especially time and scope management. Even though I had the tool to time my time work, I found that my initial planning around time allocation per task was not good due to the scope of what I wanted to achieve. I also found myself refactoring code for long periods of time and struggled on getting the aesthetics done at the end.  I ran out of time to test on GearVR and ended up not porting for VR at all. I did do a build for Android but didn't have enough time to test the application enough to confirm stable frame rates and that all inputs worked correctly.</p>	
					<p>In the future I need to spend more time on planning my approach. I will need to make sure the objectives I set for myself has enough time set aside to accomplish them and make sure their scope fits the constraint. The correct execution of my small objectives will lead to the completion of my main objective and lead to my vision being executed the way I intended it to be without design, mechanics or platforms being sacrificed to complete the application. I will also need to refresh my programming skills as I fell down some traps around efficiency and script inheritance flow I could have avoided if I planned my approach a lot better.</p>	
				
					<p>I ended up achieving my goal of getting prefabs to work for me. I got my prefabs to contain all the scripts and objects needed to make it function as intended with minimal info needed to be assigned in the editor. In the end when I ran out of time, I could place my prefabs inside a level and quickly get it all to run as intended.</p>	
					<p>I will need to plan better in the future around time and objectives that I want to achieve to make sure I am able to execute my creative vision the way I intend it to be. Planning well within my scope is the key.</p>

					<<h2><u>Week 4 : Reflecting</u></h2>
					<h3><li>Being Agile</li></h3>					
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="App Development Synergies/Week 4/Images/Agile.png" alt=""></span>This week covered reflection and I looked at how Agile software development principles could have been applied to my app jam application. I have worked in Agile development environments for the past few years and do believe in the practices applied such as scrum and being sprint focused. I have seen amazing new ideas come out of doing sprints as well as solutions to big problems that improved projects greatly. Sprints have given me the opportunity in the past to explore new options and grow my skills and creativity by rapidly prototyping new ideas.</p> 
					<p>Reading up on agile software development I discovered many methods and ways of applying agile in my correct development. I found two practices I am going to take forward into my upcoming projects to help me achieve my outcomes and goals in both design and development.</p>
					<p>In Juhani Warsta, Pekka Abrahamsson, Outi Salo and Jussi Ronkainen peer-reviewed academic literature paper on Agile Software Development Methods I stumbled upon an agile practise I found very interesting that would help me think about design more efficiently. In section 3.7 Adaptive Software Development they describe different Agile methods of which I focussed on the section 3.9.2 Pragmatic Programming method. </p>
					<p>From an agile viewpoint, the Pragmatic Programming methods focus is on incremental, iterative development, rigorous testing, and user-centered design. The approach taken here has a very practical standpoint as they are illustrated by positive and negative examples accompanied by questions and code snippet, where focus is put on withstanding changes that can happen within the industry or development process by designing software with a focus on change.</p>
					<p><u>Pragmatic programming does not have processes, phases, distinct roles or work products. The philosophy is defined in six points, which could be stated roughly as:</u></p>
					<li>Take responsibility for what you do and think solutions instead of excuses.</li>
					<li>Don’t put up with bad design or coding. Fix bugs and issues as you see them or plan them to be fixed very soon.</li>  
					<li>Take an active role in introducing change where you feel it is necessary.</li> 
					<li>Make applications that satisfies your customer/creative goals but know when to stop.</li>
					<li>Constantly broaden your knowledge.</li> 
					<li>Always improve your communication skills.</li>
					<p></p>	
					<p>My second source is a peer-reviewed academic literature case study by William Herman Morkel Theunissen on Agile software development where I focused on section 2.4.1 Extreme programming (XP). </p>
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="App Development Synergies/Week 4/Images/agile-project-management-elements-of-agile.png" alt=""></span>XP is an agile methodology that has the software team comply with well-defined and well circumscribed processes when developing software. These values need to be met before their development methodology is classifiable as XP. The most important of these processes are the four-core values, principles and characteristics XP is based on. The XP agile methodology started developing due to problems faced within software development in the form of applications not meeting the customer expectations, reduced applicability of delivered software, the inability to meet deadlines and schedules.</p>
					<p>XP may be regarded as the most published agile methodology It is based on a series of values and practices that are applied to design and quick iterations of sprints.</p>
					<p><u>The four core values of XP are:</u></p>
					<li>Communication: This involves keeping everyone on the project informed on everything regarding the project.</li>
					<li>Simplicity: To always make use of the simplest solution that can work.</li>
					<li>Feedback: Decrease iteration time between the response of doing something and getting the result. Examples of this are the time between asking a question and getting an answer, the time spent on implementing new features and confirming its success using well defined automated test cases.</li>
					<li>Courage: This refers to one’s ability to make those difficult decisions that need to be made and correct the project’s direction if needed.</li>
					<p></p>	
					<p><u>The following practices characterise XP:</u></p>
					<li>The planning game: Always plan the scope and objectives for the next release.</li>
					<li>Small releases: Release the application iteratively in short cycles as updates.</li>
					<li>Metaphor: Use simple stories to act as guidelines for the project team on how the new feature functions and how to implement it correctly.</li>
					<li>Simple design: Always make sure the application is as simple as possible at any given moment of development.</li>
					<li>Testing: Continuous testing of code should take place. This could be unit and feature test cases that are created by the client in conjunction with developers, to ensure that the application always works as intended.</li>
					<li>Refactoring: Continuously simplify and restructure the system without changing its behaviour. The purpose is to improve the quality of code. </li>
					<li>Pair programming: Develop code using two programmers at one machine. </li>
					<li>Collective ownership: Code always belongs to everyone on the team and can be changed by anyone as needed. This does not mean they got to push the code to the latest version but provides an environment for growth and learning to take place. </li>
					<li>Continuous integration: Always integrate features as it is completed into the application. </li>
					<li>40-hour week: Project team members working hours are limited to only 40 hours a week. It is believed that this increases productivity and moral among developers. </li>
					<li>On-site customer: A user or client who can answer and address questions as they arise from design or development should be made a part of the team when possible.</li>

					<h3><li>Reflecting</li></h3>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="App Development Synergies/Week 4/Images/Pathfinding.jpg" alt=""></span>Reflecting upon the App jam of week three I noticed that I did apply some of the practices involved in Agile development.  I found the practice of Extreme programming (XP) as I applied the planning game and simple design characteristics during my design phase and refactoring continuous integration along with coding standards in my development phase of the app jam. As issues in the application arose, I found myself using Pragmatic programming methods as thinking solutions instead of excuses, Fix bugs and issues as you see them, introducing change where you feel it is necessary to help me face the barriers ahead and overcome them.			
					<p>During the app jam I did practise Agile methods but didn’t always focus on all the characteristics equally and didn’t see how it all comes together. In my continuation of the app jam project across the study block I will apply Extreme programming core values when thinking about design and creating new features for my applications as it grows in complexity. 			
					<p>Applying Simplicity together with the Feedback to make sure I keep designs simple and achievable will help me keep every goal within scope and help me keep to my time allocated as well as decrease the response of doing something and getting the result. Applying these practices will need to include Courage as I will need to make difficult decisions on project direction and weather doing a feature is worth it. Continues iterations also is a characteristic I will apply as I push code up and update the application as new features are completed. Refactoring code as I go along and not lingering on this characteristic too long as it was what took up most of my time during the app jam although the features worked.
					<p>Pragmatic programming six points philosophy will be of value when I am in the developing phase of the project as problems and barriers can arise that require quick thinking. By having a “think solutions instead of excuses” mind set will help me see through the barriers and seek solutions by Constantly broaden my knowledge and finding solutions to the problems that will arise. I will also take a more active role in introducing change where I feel it is necessary using the new knowledge gained from finding solutions and broadening my knowledge of the issue of new feature. 			
					<p>When I see an issue, I will need to either fix it immediately or log the bug on Trello to be fixed sooner then later. Not putting up with bad design and coding will need to be implemented as a standard to avoid a pile up of issues and fixes breaking design going forward. 			
					<p>I will also need to know when to stop. Making applications that satisfies my creative goals but is also within my scope is the key. Knowing when to stop combined with Extreme programming core value Simplicity will keep my creative vision and scope aligned to help produce applications that meet my goals and is build as intended from design. Even if ideas end up failing its not failing at all using Agile software practices. The questions asked and the answers found builds a successful application going forward. 
					<p>My progress so far with my AR application has been slow due to the app jam. I learned so much with the Week 3 App jam and especially combining it with this week’s Agile practice. It highlighted how I could improve my approach and make sure I don’t fall in the same traps as before. 
					<p>The current status is that I have completed my first objectives set out that included getting the application building for android using the unreal engine and making the AR recognize images and flat surfaces. I have also built my two fish and have them rigged and a small amount of animation applied. I have also built a fish tank and applied glass and water shaders that has been tested on mobile platform. 			
					<p>I have lowered the scope of the project due to what I have learned from the app jam and this week’s agile methodologies and have decided to apply SMART principles to solve the small goals I have set out for myself. I have decided to go from two fish to one and make sure all features work on it before even looking at a second. My next goal is to implement the GUI and be able to feed the fish and adjust the health status that is displayed to the user.			
					<p>The specific goal set out with this feature is to have the fish recognize there is food in the tank and to go eat it. This is accomplished by having the fish know where the target is located by using path finding and destroying the object once consumed by the fish triggering +1 on hunger displayed on the GUI. 
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="App Development Synergies/Week 4/Images/shutterstock_524161369-660x330.jpg" alt=""></span>I can achieve this goal by applying simple a* pathfinding, making the food the objective for the fish. A* pathfinding solutions are widely available like the one provided by Monokkel, M. 2014. My A* Pathfinding blueprint or: How Not to Build a Blueprint. 8th August. Unreal Engine Forums. [Online]. [27 June 2019]. Available from: https://forums.unrealengine.com/community/community-content-tools-and-tutorials/12979-my-a-pathfinding-blueprint-or-how-not-to-build-a-blueprint. 			
					<p>The food itself will be physics driven as it falls to the floor of the tank, but I will leave them in place for now as my main focus is to get the pathfinding going. I will make all this possible by unitizing Unreal engine blueprints for rapid prototyping. This will be a week sprint for me to achieve this goal and I feel like it falls within my skill level as I have done things similar before.			
					<p>Having this feature completed would help my AR fish tank simulation closer to being like the real thing as fish need to eat right. Completing this goal will help me start the AI phase of the application and plan for future integrations that need to take place around behaviour. It will lay a ground base for me to work off going forward and a start to my proof of concept. 			
					<p>Giving myself a week to implement the feature is reasonable. I will be implementing the blueprint to my character in three days and spend another day or two building out to mobile and testing. I also want to leave me some time to refract code if needed and make sure everything upholds to standards and I will be pushing this up at the end of the week and applying it to my project. I left one day apart for me to reflect on the feature and how I can do things better going forward.

					<h2><u>Week 5</u></h2>				
					<h3><li>Stop! Think! Act!</li></h3>			
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="App Development Synergies/Week 5/Images/social-media-apps-2-shutterstock-650.jpg" alt=""></span>This week I completed my pathfinding for my fish and made a particle effect to solve my food issue. I learned from my faults of my previous practices in the App Jam and I started to do continuous build iterations and run my project on a physical device as soon as I had a feature completed. I ran my application on my Android s7 edge, and my application ran perfectly with no errors and a high frame rate.</p>	 
					<p>I need to work on my design and time management around d my project as I discovered l my personal case study, I did on my app jam. This was also made clear to me with my reflection of week 4, as I learned about Agile development and what solutions there are to overcome this barrier.</p>	
					<p>I had stopped everything I was doing on the application and looked at my planning and design and how to improve project and time management using Trello and the Timesheet time management tool. I also started thinking more about why I am creating some features and what meaning they hold in my application. I created a Trello board for me to manage my goals and time better and looked at what I wanted to achieve and how to get there being agile and flexible in my project management.</p>	
					<p>I looked at where my application fits into the many types of apps found in the marketplaces. I did this to know and understand where my idea’s fit into the industry and if they are relevant to what people would want to use. I see my app as gamification. Although my current design isn’t final and the features, I am working on currently can be used in many different designs. I have always seen my application being built around AR technologies that the Unreal game engine provide to solve a real-world problem by educating users on issues and solutions, as well as making them experience the world around them in new interactive ways.</p>	
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="App Development Synergies/Week 5/Images/flat-thinking-concept_23-2148163823.jpg" alt=""></span>I need to go back and make sure things are on the right path by rethinking my scope and design of around my application. I also need to take a serious look at how my application fits into the market and if it really holds any value to the clients I intent to use my application. I want to have all my trello boards set up and ready accompanied with goals and ideas that follow my newly learned agile principles as well as a plan on how I am going to integrate all these agile practices into my future development.</p>	
					<p>I know I have achieved my goal of being more agile in my planning and development when I don’t need to think about what to do next as my trello board reflect my project goals and future features that need to be implemented. This would be possible to achieve by starting my week with an hour of project time to reflect on what needs to be done next and managing how I will be achieving this goal. I will set aside one hour on a Sunday to view my tasks for the next week and setup my trello boards accordingly.</p>	
					<p>I have also completed my draft copy this week of my short comings I discovered during the app jam and will present them next week on my personal case study. I decided to focus on agile and time management objectives and cover the failures I had during the App Jam around project management.</p>

					<h2><li>Week 6</li></h2>			
					<h3><u>Sprint Goals Chapter One</u></h3>
					<p>My sprint goals have mostly consisted development tasks for of my AR application prototype, but after the personal case study I started improving my approach on projects and management by using tools like trello to manage my project and study tasks. I am happy with the approach I took in creating my boards on trello for both the App Development Synergies module and my AR project. I started populating the boards with tasks and goals that I planned out and felt the impact on time management immediately as I had clear goals now laid out and I knew what to achieve.</p>	
					<p>I could have included and tracked my research in my trello boards as I found myself finding tutorials that where relevant to Unreal Engine AR Blueprints and not documenting the links and made it hard to return to the tutorial later to review what was done. I need to start creating a tutorial lists and add cards to track tutorials I find relevant to design and development. I will create Tutorial new, viewed and implemented lists that will hold all tutorials viewed. I will also need to comment on the card viewed.</p>	
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="App Development Synergies/Week 6/destination-1285851_1280.png" alt=""></span>I need to stop taking on too many tasks at once and focus on one thing at a time. I tend to take on multiple tasks at once and jump between them as I get time. This led to time being wasted and running out as bringing myself up to speed with what I did days before took up some time and made me rush things in the end leaving no time for proper testing on physical devices to ensure the feature works as intended. Focusing on completing a single task at a time will help me complete tasks within my time constraints and test new features before release. </p>	
					<p>Setting up my trello boards have helped me focus on one task at a time that has given me a new direction I want to take my AR app idea in. During development on AR surface detection I discovered a better way of detecting surfaces by following tutorials on youtube provided by dev_enabled at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL1jcpKRApOp_CkW9LkFRKA . I implemented the new feature improvements and found I was detecting surfaces more accurately then the default ARHandheld template offered by the Unreal Engine. I have started experimenting with placing grass on the floor as you walk and turned my living room into a forest. All this was done on extra time I had left after completing my task. This is all time that was made by focus and planning.</p>	
					<p>I need to keep adding cards to lists on trello to continue my development and time management. As soon as I design something, I need to keep adding cards to trello with comments that include references to other relevant lists on the board. This has helped me with time management the past few weeks as I found myself having more time to test features regularly and fix the problem immediately as it arises leaving me with better milestone builds with less bugs and more time for the next milestone to be achieved.</p>

					<h3><li>Sprint Goal Chapter One Review</li></h3>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="App Development Synergies/Week 7/business-advantage.jpg" alt=""></span>I set out a Sprint goal for myself this week.  My Sprint goal is to make a functioning prototype of the User Interface (UI) for my AR application. Achieving this goal, I will be using Gimp to make textures. I will also use the Unreal Engine’s Widget and blueprint systems to do layout and development. Having this goal achieved and the UI setup will not only get me to start thinking about design around UX, it will also provide me with a tool to use during debugging while developing features by letting me reset and debug during runtime. This will save me time on development by helping to find bugs in my application.</p>
					<p>The functionality of the UI will be minimal and will consist of 5 buttons. A menu button will be included on the General User Interface (GUI).  The UI will consist of menu, back, start and quit buttons that provide the basic functionality to the user. I will know that my sprint goal is achieved when I can start, exit and reset my application using a UI at runtime on my mobile device. I will use my AR application Trello board to track my progress and time. I have setup a Sprint task that contains my current sprint goal as a Card and tasks that need to be completed and time spent that will help me keep track of the time limit using checklists.</p>
					<p>My backlog list of items to achieve the sprint goal is arranged from high priority to low priority. Creating button textures and doing the layout will be high priority as I will need to have these items completed before I can prototype the UI. This shouldn’t take more than 2 hours as I will use gimp to create a single button to use across the UI and add text and do my layout inside Unreal Engine using widgets.</p>
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="App Development Synergies/Week 7/header-front-end-development.png" alt=""></span><p>Next on the list is developing the functionality to the UI and should take no longer than 3 hours. During the development of the UI functionality continuous testing will occur inside the editor. The final task of my sprint goal is physical device testing. This process should not take longer than 1 hour as continuous testing during development should help produce no errors or bugs.</p>
					<p>I have set the sprint time limit to 2 weeks and limited the hours spent to 4 hours per week. This would be enough time to complete the tasks that need to be done and complete the sprint goal as I have done UI prototyping before using the Unreal Engine.  The total of 6 hours it should take to complete my tasks set out will leave me with 2 hours for new tasks and problems that arise making the sprint goal achievable within the 8-hour limit. All tasks of the sprint could change during development. As new tasks arise, I will add them and include priority while considering the time limit and the final goal I want to achieve.</p>

					<h3><li>Spring Goal Chapter Two</li></h3>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="App Development Synergies/Week 8/BarryOvereem11Advatanges.jpg" alt=""></span>I started to take new direction with my application this week as I complete my sprint goal I set out for myself. I started doing research into applications that could help me achieve my goal of planning out the UI before developing and implementing it into my application.</p>	
					<p>I chose Adobe XD for its Responsive Resize feature that automatically adjusts and sizes images as and layouts of my boards to screen sizes. This feature helps my UI stay flexible and responsive as well as the ability to adapt and scale to the different mobile screen sizes available. Adobe XD also works very well in prototyping the UI by wireframing and creating simple interactive click through prototypes. This helps me track the flow of my UI and design smart around functionality. </p>	
					<p>I found using Adobe XD quite hard due to the workflow being so much different from other software I am used to using like Maya and the Unreal Engine. I found tutorials at  https://helpx.adobe.com/africa/xd/tutorials.html done by the adobe team that I could follow to get myself doing the basics. </p>	
					<p>During the process of making my boards I found that not only do I have a lack of understanding around planning UI design and creating prototypes, but learning this skill and applying it using Adobe XD will require me to learn more about the program itself and designs done by others.</p>	
					<p>Investing time into Adobe XD will help me learn an important skill I require for application development in the future. I need to learn to plan and create my UI and UX designs inside Adobe XD. I will also need to start looking at other UI designs and learn from the problems they faced developing for the different applications and platforms available on the market. </p>	
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="App Development Synergies/Week 8/goal.jpg" alt=""></span>I will achieve these goals by continuing to view at least two tutorials a week from https://helpx.adobe.com/africa/xd/tutorials.html and build my knowledge of how to use Adobe XD to its full potential and create my own prototypes and designs for application I want to design in the future. I also want to take 60 minutes a week to explore interesting UI designs done by other AR applications on the market. This will help me grow my knowledge of different UI, what challenges they faced and how to overcome them using design that is flexible and adaptive.</p>	
					<p>I want to be able to design and create prototypes of my own UI design by the end of this module. I’m not aiming to be a professional in the field of Adobe XD and UI prototyping, but to be able to create a basic design, plan and UI layout. Understanding this process will help me plan future applications UI accurately and make the development process much easier and leave me with less roadblocks and issues that may arise from a lack of planning ahead.</p>	
					<p>I know I have achieved this goal set out when I am able to create and prototype my UI ideas inside Adobe XD without having to look at tutorials for help. It will also be a clear indicator that I have achieved what I set out to do when I refer to my Adobe XD designs with more details and functionality documented rather than my simple drawings and basic planning as before.</p>	 
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="App Development Synergies/Week 8/Adobe-XD-free.jpg" alt=""></span>By following the tutorials and lessons provided by Adobe on XD I can achieve this goal within the time set out. In two weeks, I want to have a simple example of my UI completed in Adobe XD and make sure to continue to add to it as it grows in complexity. I want to have a basic UI layout completed in four weeks that I can follow to improve my UI prototype as it stands.</p>

					<h3><li>Sprint Goal Chapter Two Review</li></h3>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="App Development Synergies/Week 9/1_vzCPKrGqBtZ0NLeDb08X7Q.jpeg" alt=""></span>After reading the Articles Sprint Planning Meeting and Task Boards I created a new Trello board that focuses specifically on my sprints to help me keep track of what I want to achieve and how I want to do so. For my new sprints goal, I created a user story to keep me aligned with what I need to achieve while keeping the way I achieve the goal agile and flexible. My user story is as follows “As a user, I want to be able to see what my backyard would look like if it was covered in grass”. </p>
					<p>To accomplish this goal, I have created lists inside my new Sprint Trello board. These include Story, To Do, In Process, To Verify and Done. What I want to accomplish is to be able to take a floor area and detect its surface using my ARX project and have the user place grass on the area.  I want to achieve this goal within two weeks and have set aside three hours a week for my sprint. </p>
					<p>I want to achieve this goal as it will start the main functionality of changing surfaces and environments. This is the main functionality of my application and will provide me with a simple framework to build on and extend my library of surfaces and object that can be placed in the user’s surroundings.</p>
					<div align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gll5-kXyq58" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
					<p></p>	
					<p>I will know I have achieved my sprint goal when I am able to change a detected surface material to soil as well as place grass on top of the soil using a basic library UI on a physical device using my ARX application. This goal is achievable due to the past UI and surface detection sprints that I completed successfully in weeks six and seven. The UI sprint of week seven has made it simple for me to add new UI functions quickly and my surface detection sprint of week six gave me accurate surface detection and made it possible to place objects and change materials of the surface detection grid created when surfaces are detected in my ARX Application.</p>
					<p>I can commit to the three hours a week for two weeks as I will dedicate one and a half hours at the end of my day on Tuesdays and Thursdays to complete the sprint goal. Using my new Trello board for my sprint I will track my progress and time spent to assure I stay within the time, scope and in alignment with the user story I set out. </p>
					<p>Moving and completing cards in my To Do list will provide me with an indication of progress as I will move cards created from To Do into my In Process and finally on completion into Done Lists in Trello. Cards also have checklists assigned to them to help me plan my approach and see what needs to be done for the specific task set out.</p>
					<p>I have started my sprint during the planning phase that happened on Thursday 1st of August and will complete the goal by 11th of August. I have built UI library systems before and with the UI base I have completed in my earlier sprints, I will be able to quickly add new functionality and expand into a library containing materials and objects.</p>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="App Development Synergies/Week 9/input_devices.png" alt=""></span>I know I can complete this quickly as I will keep it simple and only do one object and one material the user can place. I already have a ground material with textures and low poly mobile friendly grass that can be used in the sprint and have already set up my touch inputs to be able to instantiate objects on the surface of my grid created by my ARX application surface detection.I am very excited to start creating some simple inputs for the user to interact with the environment around them using my ARX application.</p>

					<h2><u>Week 10</u></h2>
					<h3><li>Time to Reset and Adjust</li></h3>
					<p>After my Sprint goal of the past few weeks and setting everything up for my project management around Agile practices, I started doing my User Personas and found a big issue with my application. I don’t believe it is very relevant in the industry and I am also not sure why I am developing it. The bigger picture is around designing your home and helping you better visualize your surroundings in a new way, but I feel my features that I have created doesn’t really align very well with the bigger picture of my app.</p>
					<p>So, in the end I have decided to scrap my AR application. I have learned a lot about using Unreal in an AR environment and mobile development. I also discovered my lack of project management, UX/UI design and Market Research. These are obstacles I will need to overcome in the future to become a successful Creative App Developer. I will be righting about my obstacles in the and challenges in the upcoming Report on Continuing Personal and Professional Development as well as how I will overcome them.</p>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="App Development Synergies/Week 10/effective-rapid-prototyping-diagram.jpg" alt=""></span>Moving forward I have decided to use Unity for my mobile development as I want to be able to rapid prototype and deploy to mobile for fast testing cycles [Refrence 2]. Being able to deliver quick prototypes for testing will help my application chance of success in the long run as features developed can receive feedback quickly that can help me adjust what I am doing to keep the application on track with what my user wants instead of what I think would work [Refrence 1].</p>
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="App Development Synergies/Week 10/download.png" alt=""></span>Failing to receive feedback early in the development process will lead to long periods of time where features are developed with no real understanding of their relevancy and development that fluctuates very little with low contribute to knowledge flowing slowly between users and development teams [Refrence 1]. This also leads to long cycles between getting new information of features required by users that would have been more relevant to the experience.</p>
					<p>To achieve this, I will need to understand the new features that has been introduced into Unity specifically around rapid prototyping. I will need to dedicate two hours a week to learn the new features that have been included in Unity 3D specific to rapid prototyping for mobile devices. I will know I have achieved this when I start to see features being prototyped successfully in a shorter amount of time during sprints and regular development leaving me with quick feedback from peers and users to improve my application. </p>

					<h3><li>Sprint Goal Review</li></h3>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="App Development Synergies/Week 9/1_vzCPKrGqBtZ0NLeDb08X7Q.jpeg" alt=""></span>After reading the Articles Sprint Planning Meeting and Task Boards I created a new Trello board that focuses specifically on my sprints to help me keep track of what I want to achieve and how I want to do so. For my new sprints goal, I created a user story to keep me aligned with what I need to achieve while keeping the way I achieve the goal agile and flexible. My user story is as follows “As a user, I want to be able to see what my backyard would look like if it was covered in grass”. </p>
					<p>To accomplish this goal, I have created lists inside my new Sprint Trello board. These include Story, To Do, In Process, To Verify and Done. What I want to accomplish is to be able to take a floor area and detect its surface using my ARX project and have the user place grass on the area.  I want to achieve this goal within two weeks and have set aside three hours a week for my sprint. </p>
					<p>I want to achieve this goal as it will start the main functionality of changing surfaces and environments. This is the main functionality of my application and will provide me with a simple framework to build on and extend my library of surfaces and object that can be placed in the user’s surroundings.</p>
					<p>I will know I have achieved my sprint goal when I am able to change a detected surface material to soil as well as place grass on top of the soil using a basic library UI on a physical device using my ARX application. This goal is achievable due to the past UI and surface detection sprints that I completed successfully in weeks six and seven. The UI sprint of week seven has made it simple for me to add new UI functions quickly and my surface detection sprint of week six gave me accurate surface detection and made it possible to place objects and change materials of the surface detection grid created when surfaces are detected in my ARX Application.</p>
					<p>I can commit to the three hours a week for two weeks as I will dedicate one and a half hours at the end of my day on Tuesdays and Thursdays to complete the sprint goal. Using my new Trello board for my sprint I will track my progress and time spent to assure I stay within the time, scope and in alignment with the user story I set out. </p>
					<p>Moving and completing cards in my To Do list will provide me with an indication of progress as I will move cards created from To Do into my In Process and finally on completion into Done Lists in Trello. Cards also have checklists assigned to them to help me plan my approach and see what needs to be done for the specific task set out.</p>
					<p>I have started my sprint during the planning phase that happened on Thursday 1st of August and will complete the goal by 11th of August. I have built UI library systems before and with the UI base I have completed in my earlier sprints, I will be able to quickly add new functionality and expand into a library containing materials and objects.</p>
					<p>I know I can complete this quickly as I will keep it simple and only do one object and one material the user can place. I already have a ground material with textures and low poly mobile friendly grass that can be used in the sprint and have already set up my touch inputs to be able to instantiate objects on the surface of my grid created by my ARX application surface detection.</p>
					<p>I am very excited to start creating some simple inputs for the user to interact with the environment around them using my ARX application. </p>

					<h2><u>Week 12 : Report on Continuing Personal and Professional Development</u></h2>
					<h4><li>Introduction</li></h4>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="App Development Synergies/Week 12/Reasons-to-Try-iPhone-App-Development-Right-Now.jpg" alt=""></span>During my time in Application development Synergies module I have learned a lot about the barriers and challenges that I would need to overcome to be an effective practitioner of Creative Application Development. My career goal of developing successful Mobile VR and AR applications relies on me learning and mastering these skills and tools to create financially successful applications in the future.</p>
					<p>I have found myself building mobile VR and AR applications using the Unity 3D and Unreal Engine in the of Creative Application Development module. This has made me question what the best tools to use are for what I want to do, how to improve my project and time management to work more efficient, how to improve my UI/UX I implement and if what I am developing is relevant to using my applications?</p>
					<p></p>
					<h4><li>Unity</li></h4>
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="App Development Synergies/Week 12/dims.jpg" alt=""></span>This brings me to my first challenge I faced in becoming a better application developer. What engine to use for mobile application development and why? I am experienced in both the Unreal Engine and Unity 3D and have released applications using both the engines in the past, but the skill I realised I need to work on is making the correct choice around what tools to use in building my applications. In the App Development Synergies module, I develop an AR and VR applications in both Unreal Engine and Unity.  During my App Jam where I had to create an application in a short amount of time I decided to go with Unity over Unreal due to the rapid prototyping advantage over the Unreal Engine which can provide me with huge advantages when it comes to quick build iterations that leads to quick feedback from users.</p>
					<p>In Muilu, Tuomo, Nguyen, Dirin & Amir’s paper [4], they found one of the reasons Unity works so well for Rapid prototyping is due to the Unity Editor’s visually based interface that has drag and drop functionality where the user can add scripts quickly to objects by using for example the add-on system that allows for objects to receive properties of UI elements such as buttons without the need to code from scratch. </p>
					<p>I found this to be helpful to quickly do scripts in C# and tie them into my objects to have something running for testing. [5] Jiangping Wan, Ruoting Wang’s research states that releasing early and often to recieve feedback, is one of the most important parts for software development as it promotes the fast flow of knowledge between the user and the team developing the application. This shows huge advantages when it comes to developing features in that it helps you stop guessing what your users might want and instead hear from them directly what they need.</p>
					<p>Being able to deliver quick prototypes for testing will help my applications in the future be more relevant and increase the success in the long run as features developed can recieve feedback quickly that can help me adjust what I am doing to keep the application on track with what my user wants instead of what I think would work.</p>
					<p>Failing to receive feedback early in the development process will lead to long periods of time where features are developed with no real understanding of their relevancy and development that fluctuates very little with low contribute to knowledge flowing slowly between users and development teams [5]. This also leads to long cycles between getting new information of features required by users that would have been more relevant to the experience.</p>
					<p>To achieve this, I will need to understand the new features that has been introduced into Unity that can speed up rapid prototyping. I will need to dedicate two hours a week to learn the new features that have been included in Unity 3D specific to rapid prototyping for mobile devices. I will take this hour at the end of my week and implement it as a trello board with Unity research cards where I comment and post my findings.</p>
					<p>I will know I have achieved this when I start to see features being prototyped successfully in a shorter amount of time during sprints and regular development leaving me with quick feedback from peers and users to improve my application. This will be long term goal as tools and software is ever changing in the industry and there will always be new features integrated into Unity as updates are released.</p>	
					<h4><li>C#</li></h4>	
					<p><p><span class="image left"><img src="App Development Synergies/Week 12/Logo-C-Sharp.png" alt=""></span>My second barrier is C# scripting in Unity. I have extended knowledge of C#, I have found that my knowledge around how to use it within unity is outdated as of lately. As [3] Antonín Šmíd describes the two differences of the engine’s choices of scripting languages. Unity uses C# as the dominant scripting language where Unreal offers native C++ or Blueprint visual scripting. Even though I have knowledge of C#, the language has changed quite a bit during the development of Unity and how it is implemented. These changes have led to better ways of managing C# render jobs that can help manage what is drawn on the screen at a time to get the highest frame rate out of my applications as indicated by [6] Unity update blog.</p>	
					<p>Understanding the new implementation of C# in Unity would also be important in how scripts can be added and reused for the object in the scene so that even a non-coder game designer could use them to design and prototype something as indicated by [3] Antonín Šmíd fither. Being able to apply C# depends on the engine’s editor and how it deals with attaching these scripts to the objects in a scene and in Unity, the game designer can add scripts made in C# as a component of an specific object as well as set the properties manually from the object in the editor without having to go back to their compiler. </p>	
					<p>Using these features that Unity provides along with C# can help me create scripts that are easy to integrate and adapt into my applications while making sure I utilize the latest features and techniques provided by Unity. </p>	
					<p>Applying these skills would lead to a more bug free and correct code written as well as make sure UI am able to use the new features the Unity team integrates into their Unity 3D engine. Failing to understand these new coding practises will result in my applications having to use old versions of the Unity engine that can leave my application lacking in the latest features and techniques that the engine can provide, leaving me behind in the ever changing industry of mobile development.</p>	
					<p>To achieve this goal of understanding C# development in the latest versions of Unity, I will be taking the C# Programming for Unity Game Development Specialization on Coursera. This course lasts 24 weeks and I can complete it at my own pace. I will be putting four hours every Sunday aside to complete this short course that will provide me with a base understanding of C# to work from.</p>	
					<p>I know I have achieved my goal of understanding C# and the latest features it offers in unity better when I can utilize the new Job systems and Scriptable Render Pipeline to get the most out of my application look and feel while keeping frame rate high and effective with no bugs or errors.</p>	
					<h4><li>UI/UX design</li></h4>
					<p><p><span class="image right"><img src="App Development Synergies/Week 12/difference-between-ux-ui-ux-ui-min-6cd3a171087987d31ecdb67ad67c0ab8136242f7b4e476a0e509017aa8bbc755.png" alt=""></span>My UI/UX design skills have left my application hard to interact with in the past. Being able to plan out my application UI before going into development is a skill I will need to focus on and include in my planning phase of my application. I will also need to make my planning interactive so that I can receive feedback on what works and doesn’t quickly to be able to adapt my UI/UX. </p>	
					<p>Being able to adapt to feedback from users while in the design phase holds huge advantages as indicated by [8] Sari Kujala paper that suggests that early user involvement has generally positive effects to applications, especially on user satisfaction as the UI/UX adapts from feedback received. Evidence suggest that using users as a primary information source for your UI/UX is an effective means of requirements capture and will provide more accurate designs around features and how users interact with your application.</p>	
					<p>The fact that Interfaces are closely related to design and interaction is clearly show in [7] Heonsik Joo research that shows how Interface design plays a role in visually linking applications and how that affects the usability of the system, contents, and services that your application provides. Failing to be effective in UI/UX design can leave my user experience lacking and deter users from using my applications. It can also result in some features being misunderstood or never used due to poor design, planning and lack of user feedback.</p>	
					<p>To design my UI/UX for my applications in the future I will need to learn Adobe XD. I chose this tool for its Responsive Resize feature that automatically adjusts and sizes images as and layouts of my boards to mobile screen sizes. This feature helps my UI stay flexible and responsive and receive feedback from users before starting development. </p>	
					<p>Adobe XD also works very well in prototyping the UI by wireframing and creating simple interactive click through prototypes. This helps me track the flow of my UI and design smart around functionality as well as give me the ability to demonstrate my prototype of the UI/UX in an interactive way to my users for instant feedback.</p>	
					<p>Investing time into Adobe XD will help me learn an important skill I require for planning my UI/UX systems in the future. I need to learn to plan and create my UI and UX designs inside Adobe XD and I will also need to start looking at other UI designs and learn from the problems they faced developing for the different applications and platforms available on the market.</p>	
					<p>I will achieve these goals by continuing to view at least two tutorials a week from https://helpx.adobe.com/africa/xd/tutorials.html and build my knowledge of how to use Adobe XD to its full potential. I also want to take 60 minutes a week to explore interesting UI designs done by other mobile AR and VR applications on the market. This will help me grow my knowledge of different UI, what challenges they faced and how to overcome them using design that is flexible and adaptive.</p>	
					<p>I want to be able to design and create prototypes of my own UI design by the end of this module. I’m not aiming to be a professional in the field of Adobe XD and UI prototyping, but to be able to create a basic design, plan and UI layout. Understanding this process will help me plan future applications UI accurately and make the development process much easier and leave me with less roadblocks and issues that may arise from a lack of planning ahead.</p>	
					<p>I know I have achieved this goal set out when I am able to create and prototype my UI ideas inside Adobe XD without having to look at tutorials for help. It will also be a clear indicator that I have achieved what I set out to do when I refer to my Adobe XD designs to receive feedback from my users. </p>	
					<h4><li>Project organization</li></h4>	
					<p><p><span class="image left"><img src="App Development Synergies/Week 12/SU-Zaffron-Leadership-Conversations-Digital-Business-Management-1200-300x300.jpg" alt=""></span>Project organization and being able to adapt agile development practices in planning my projects going forward is an essential skill I need to acquire. Being Agile can help me determine my scope more accurately as well as manage my time more efficiently to achieve what I set out to do in a shorter amount of time. Besides the scope and time management benefits of being Agile in planning my projects, practicing agile methodologies like Pragmatic programming which focuses on flexible design and programming practices can also lower production cost and enhance the overall quality of the product as indicated by [1] Zahid Ali Masood and Samia Farooq.</p>	
					<p>Applying agile practices by creating Trello boards for my projects and creating Sprints goal cards on project boards will help me make sure that my time is not wasted, and my scope isn’t set outside of my limitations. It will also increase production as the goals that need to be achieved are well defined and planned out, making it hard to stray off what needs to be done and what I have set out to achieve. This will also help me from getting overwhelmed and keep me focused on what need to be achieved to keep the project moving forward, leading to more getting done in a shorter amount of time.</p>	
					<p>I need to create Trello boards that contain my project task cards and make sure I set priorities, with time limits and task lists of what must be completed for the task to be successful and ready to integrate into my projects. I will need to commit time to this practice at the start of each week so that I can go over my goals and ideas and make sure I know exactly what has to be done, what the time limit is and that if issues or barriers arise they can be addressed early and added to tasks to stay flexible and agile. </p>	
					<p>Failing to be agile will leave me overwhelmed and unorganized in the number of tasks that need to be completed. It would also lead to time wasting as I try to figure out what needs to be done next steering off the path of my application design goals. It leaves me in a space where I end up creating features with no idea what’s next and not knowing how what I am creating now will influence future development and features. I experienced this first hand during the App Jam as I ended up having 3 hours left that I couldn’t use due to bugs that would be introduced as I didn’t plan further ahead than one feature at a time, making integration and expanding on current features with new ideas a very timely process.</p>	
					<p>Being Agile will help me become a better Creative Application Developer by helping me plan around the scope and time I have available, with the resources I have at my disposal and deliver higher quality applications without overwhelming myself leading to disorder in my project and loosing focus on what I wanted to achieve.</p>	
					<h4><li>Market Research</li></h4>	
					<p><p><span class="image right"><img src="App Development Synergies/Week 12/Market-1-990x526.jpeg" alt=""></span>A skill I never put too much though into, that was brought to my attention during the Creative Application Development course has been knowing my audience and if what I am making is relevant and addresses consumer market needs. This is a big barrier I will need to overcome as the advantage of knowing your users and their pains lead to creating applications that are relevant to users and the industry, increasing the success rate that the applications I develop during and after the Creative Application Development course can have.</p>	
					<p>Obtaining the skill to understand my audience and creating personas won’t just help me design apps that are relevant in the industry, but also keep my goals, features and project in line with user needs and help developers and engineers understand what, and for who the application is being developed, leading to more relevant user focused features being implemented and developed.  These advantages have been tested and proven in a paper published by [2] Jane Billestrup, Jan Stage, Lene Nielsen and Kira Storgaard Nielsen and clearly show the advantages that personas and understanding your users can have for both designers and developers working on the application.</p>	
					<p>Research found that [2] not knowing what and who your audience and users are and what pains they have, can lead to bad design choices being made and lead developers down the wrong path. This will impact cost of development, deadlines and can lead to applications being developed that aren’t focused on user needs and don’t quite solve their users problems as intended leaving the application dead on the market or costing huge amount of hours and resources to be allocated to regain direction.</p>	
					<p>I need to start creating personas for my applications to start understanding what I want to build, if its relevant and if it solves my users’ specific needs and pains. I will be using Adobe XD due to its simple interactive click through prototype feature that will help me when I need to create multiple personas with multiple user needs. Using the interactive features will help me connect their stories and layout my user needs and problems I want to address. I also need to use stories from these user personas I have created to define my sprint goals and create Trello boards with tasks lists and stories that reflect those of my user’s needs.</p>	
					<p>I know I have achieved my goal when I start designing around my user personas rather then my own ideas and create sprint goals that reflect my users needs rather than just what must be done next. Creating personas will lead to more detailed sprint descriptions and tasks derived from them with stories rather then just need to do’s leading to agile user focused development and design. I have the resources to achieve my goal as I already have an adobe license and have my project set up in Trello. Along with the time I set aside for Planning and being Agile on the start of my week, I will need to include my personas and plan around my users’ needs and pains.</p>	
					<h4><li>Conclusion</li></h4>	
					<p><p><span class="image left"><img src="App Development Synergies/Week 12/conclusion@2x-1.png" alt=""></span>Overcoming these obstacles and obtaining the skills indicated will help me become a more efficient practitioner of Creative Application development and achieve my career goals of developing VR and AR applications that succeed in the industry. </p>	
					<p>It will also help me be a better developer around C# and Unity and help me make better choices about the tools I use. It will also help me understand my user better by receiving quick feedback by forcing me to be asking questions about why and for who I am developing applications along with how my users will interact with what I have created, creating more relevant and successful applications inside the AR and VR mobile development field.</p>
