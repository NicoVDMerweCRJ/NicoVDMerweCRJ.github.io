					<h2><u>Week 1: Interduction</u></h2>
					
					<h3><u>Contextual Research</u></h4>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="App Development Synergies/Week 1/Images/UnrealLogo.jpg" alt="" /></span>My research into my project idea posted for week 1 was centred around the Unreal Engine and how to integrate AR Core features in an application. I found a QuickStart guide to ARCore at <a href="https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/unreal/quickstart"> Unreal Quickstart</a> and followed the guide lines provided by Goolge and the team at Unreal.</p>							
					<p>My findings where that it was simple to set up the Plugin inside the unreal environment and load a template to play around with and deploy to my testing device. The setup for mobile inside Unreal was a straightforward setup and deployment to mobile was easy and quick.</p>
					<p>There have been huge improvements in deployment times in the last two releases of the unreal engine. Packaging and deployment have been a huge focus for Epic following the success of Fortnite on mobile and they have started integrating the technology used to optimize and deploy for mobile into the engine and huge feature updates and improvements on mobile is showing.</p>							
					<p>I choose to run the application on Vulkan due to the strides made in frame rates and rendering by the open source 3D graphics and computing API. I tried to run my AR core with Vulkan and hit my first barrier in my application design. Vulkan does not support AR rendering as of yet.</p>								
					<p>I’m am going to use the ASTC 3.1 format to compress my content as it does the highest quality compression and retains a lot of the quality while doing so. I refreshed my memory on the basics of unreal mobile development and different compression strategies for my files by viewing a live stream that Unreal hosted: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRhjTD7FIuI"> Unreal Stream</a> </p>
					<p>I really appreciated how this week’s exercise has made me think a bit outside of what I usually do. It was challenging and getting the blog up and running on github pages was also a great experience in setting up and I see the value of git hub beyond just hosting code repositories, but seeing the potential of hosting a blog or examples of work done on a domain of your choice. </p>							
					<p>I found out that Mobile has a limit of 75 on Unreal Engine 4 deployment as confirmed in the forums located at: <a href="https://answers.unrealengine.com/questions/482412/want-to-increase-bone-limit-on-mobile-more-than-75.html"> answers.unrealengine.com</a>. It can be increased apparently, but then older devices might not recognize the structure and fail to display the character at all.</p>
											
					<h3><u>Project Development</u></h4>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="App Development Synergies/Week 1/Images/ARCore.png" alt="" /></span>I will use the Unreal 4.22 engine to design the application and utilize blueprint and C++ for development. I choose Android (26 – Oreo and up) as my platform of choice for this project as it supports Vulkan and Google ARcore which are two core plugins/tools I plan to use. My compiler will be Visual Studio 2018 and all code will be compiled from source code of the Unreal Engine as it will be required during plugin integration.</p>
					<p>I want to integrate AR into the application and provide a feature where the user can place the fish tank on any surface in a real-world location and then interact with your fish. I will implement this feature using Google ARcore technology that comes as a plugin with the Unreal Engine.</p>
					<p>Assets needed are created using a combination of Blender and GIMP. Both Blender and gimp are free to use open source and will cover all my animation, modelling and texturing needs for my assets. I will be using only a few assets at first as the focus will be on interaction and AR rather then content at the start of development. 
Animation will be physics driven for some objects so only basic rigging and bone structures will be required. The two fish will need to be rigged and skinned for animation and a bone structure of 15 bones will be used. Mobile has a limit of 75 on Unreal Engine 4 deployment, but this should not be a issue as assets won’t benefit from a complex one structure for animation.
Textures will be 2k resolution and all materials are developed in Unreal Engine using the material editor and blueprinting.</p>

					<h3><u>Coursework</u></h4>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="App Development Synergies/Week 1/Images/UIMainMenuDesignFlowChart.jpg" alt="" /></span>I have an idea for an application to that I feel fits into the theme of ”As long as we have each other, we will never run out of problems”.</p>	
					<p>The application will tell the story of two fish living together in a fish tank. You have control of one fish called Bob and need to stay alive for as long as you can while challenges arise throughout your day. The entire application takes place in one fish tank so minimal assets are required. The focus will be on your interactions with the fish your control.</p>	
					<p>During the day Steve will be a burden and at night an ally. I wanted to tie the application into the theme “As long as we have each other, we will never run out of problems” by showing how two fish live in a tank. I found the inspiration for my design after staring at my fish tank I have at home. I have 3 fish in the tank and they always fight during the day but huddle up at night. As much as they have one another and need each other to survive, they will always have problems.</p>
