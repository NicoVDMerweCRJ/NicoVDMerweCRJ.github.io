					<h2><u>Week 1</u></h2>
					<h3><li>Game Design</li></h3>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 1/Images/AFSLogo.png" alt=""/></span>I have been working on an AR project from the Live Brief Design and Development module. I received a brief from Ashers Farm Sanctuary to help develop an app that would help increase donations, help with staff shortages and engagement with the animals on the farm. The brief led to an app being developed called the Ashers Farm Sanctuary Smart Guide that helps the visitors experience the farm through an AR driven environment.</p>							
					<p>The app provided a digital tour to visitors that would also help educate them on the stories of the animals along with direct access to donations during the tour. The tour consisted of a physical marker in the form of an Image card that can be located in front of each animal's pen. When the image is scanned by the visitor, information about the animal in the pen along with donation options would appear in AR that would encourage donations and education via your smartphone.</p>
					<p>Research was done on the farm in the form of questionnaires answered by visitors to the farm. This research determined the most common operating system used on smartphones along with the average visitor age.</p>
					<p>The visitor age research conducted defined the look and feel of the models made for the application. Due to the younger age group the animals were given a toon feel rather than realistic. The other research conducted drove the platform of choice and technology stack that would be implemented during the development.</p>
					<p>The app was tested on the farm by visitors and received an overwhelmingly positive response. The client was very happy and the MVP was a success.</p>

					<p></p>

					<h3><li>Individual Project Ideas</li></h3>
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 1/Images/ARImages.jpg" alt=""/></span>I have decided to continue developing the application during this module. I will be involved with Ashes Farm Sanctuary again this module to gain research towards the development and design direction of the application.</p>
					<p>During the development of the application this module I would like to implement a dialog system to the application so that the 3D models can communicate with the visitors and develop a dialog. This would be story driven like found in video games such as Mass Effect and would encourage engagement by the visitors by also featuring a small minigame where they get to feed the animal in the application.</p>
					<p>The farm itself becomes the playground and the story can help educate visitors on the animals and tell the story of the sanctuary and their vision. This holds a big advantage when it comes to educating visitors as indicated by [1] Dickey, M.D. study on Game Design Narrative for Learning: Appropriating Adventure Game Design Narrative Devices and Techniques for the Design of Interactive Learning Environments. The research shows that narrative will be able to support problem solving within the environments I create by educating users. Educating users through this way of dialog will blend the world around with the AR digital realm much better as the user associates the one with the other. If the dialog is used correctly I can blend the AR with the real to make the world created in the application feel more real and promote interaction by the users and increase education by doing rather than seeing.</p>
					<p>This goal will be achieved using the Unreal Engine and ARCore technologies along with the MVP I have already built and tested. I would like to achieve this goal by the end of this module and replicate the design from a single pen seamlessly to eight others. I would like to achieve this goal to be able to turn the farm into a digital AR flipbook that blends with reality while solving the problems that Ashers Farm Sanctuary face. </p>
					<p>Implementing the naterive would not be too complicated. I am using the plugin Blueprint DIalogs for the Unreal Engine to implement my dialogs into the application. By using this plugin it would help me quickly implement dialog and also leave room for voice over at a later stage. The dialogs will be written by Ashers Farm Sanctuary who has received a donation by a children's book writer to conduct the dialogs for the app.</p>
					<p>I will know I have reached this goal when the application can tell a small story at a location and provide interactive dialogs to the user. This will include a small mini game that will encourage interaction with the real world pen by the user to determine answers to questions.</p>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 1/Images/BPDialogsPluginImage.png" alt=""/></span>I will know that I am moving forward when I see my sprints that are set out completed on time and the application taking shape as the animals' dialogs appear. This can be achieved due to the stability of the MVP developed in the previous module. I already have all the models and animations and need to put everything together and integrate the dialog system which I am familiar with already and have integrated into projects in the past.</p>
					<p>Given the time set out for the project to be completed I do believe I have enough time. I will be breaking the project down into sprints which will drive the development of the project. This leaves room for change and flexibility by using Agile Methodologies to drive development. In the past I have run into barriers that involved the shutdown of production due to unforeseen circumstances. In South Africa we are experiencing Load Shedding which shuts off the power in cities for three hours at a time twice a day. Being Agile is perfect for handling unforeseen situations as indicated by [2]. Stefan H Thomke; Donald G Reinertsen; did a study on Agile product development which featured the managing and development flexibility in uncertain environments.</p>
					<p>Due to the instability of the country atm and moving forward, me and the client have agreed to continue with the agile sprint method for development to keep things moving no matter the circumstances. Staying flexible with agile would also help reduce the need for accurate long-term forecasts as we are not sure what could happen in the coming weeks.</p>
					<p>The study  introduces the notion of development flexibility and found that projects using agile  outperformed projects using inflexible technologies by a factor of 2.2 in extreme circumstances and when under pressure. This is of huge value to the project and will help things move forward even when circumstances are not favorable.</p>

					<h3><li>Sprint Planning</li></h3>
					<p>For my next sprint in the development of the Ashers Farm Sanctuary Guide Application I will be integrating the dialog plugin. I will also be prepping the dialog system to receive the text from the writer and start developing the sequences that animations should follow when the story is told. I would like to complete the welcome stage where the character walks in and a dialog appears that welcomes the player to the pen and encourages them to explore the pen further.</p>	
					<p>The sprint will take place over two weeks and will be monitored on Trello where I have been working with the Applications past sprints conducted up to release v1.1 of the application.</p>

					<h2><u>Week 2</u></h2>
					<h3><li>Fictional Worlds & Game Mechanics</li></h3>			
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 2/Images/CharGameImage.jpg" alt=""/></span>In week two of the module I was given an exercise to Create a game. The brief asked me to imagine how you could build a game based on the character's everyday life when it suddenly takes a dramatic turn while the situation changes suddenly and the person is forced to step up and go beyond what they thought was humanly possible. Luckily, they have your trusty app to give them extra superpowers.</p>
					<h4><li>Mechanics</li></h4>	
					<p>Point and click adventure game filled with puzzles. The puzzles consist of bringing images to life or drawing new ones to enter the world to overcome obstacles in the characters life.</p>
					<h4><li>Summery</li></h4>	
					<p>David Muller is an Illustrator that takes life day by day. He is always on time for work and leaves at exactly the right moment. He works for a Game Development company and his day is mainly made up of drawing Illustrations of Characters that will be integrated into video games developed by the company.</p>
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 2/Images/Persona.png" alt=""/></span>During one normal day, David finishes work and heads over to his car. As he reaches the door of the vehicle he notices that someone broke into his car. As David sighs and starts looking around for what the thieves took. He hears a voice telling him to turn around. Two thieves hold him up with a knife and force his wallet and keys out of his pocket.</p>
					<p>As David tried to stop them his bag with his drawings fell to the ground and the drawings started to come alive. As the characters of his dark mind tore the thieves limb from limb he realised that he has been granted the ability to bring creations to life.</p>
					<p>As the burglars lay lifeless on the ground the characters go back into the page and become drawings again. With his new found ability he sets out to experience life with his new found ability.</p>
					<h4><li>Deliverable</li></h4>	
					<p>The app is made for smartphones and Nintendo switch. The app will feature the first episode in the story of David Muller, the app developer from Cape Town. The first chapter will deliver a single boss at the end of the episode and it would hold around 3 hours worth of content to drive the story. It will release at a reduced price to kick start the episodic series.</p>

				<h3><li>Suspension of Disbelief</li></h3>			
				<p>The study of [1] Douglas William Brown on “The suspension of disbelief in videogames” was covered in the module this week.</p>

				<p><a href="Individual Design and Development/Week 3/Documents/The_suspension_of_disbelief_in_videogame.pdf"> The Suspension of Disbelief in Videogame Download</a></p>
				<p>I did a chapter review on Chapter 3 and found multiple ways that the findings in the study could be applied to the current application development and design. I have also included a progress report that was required as a handin this week on the current sprints and development on the app.</p>

				<p></p>
				<h3><li>Sprint Retrospective</li></h3>
				<p>During a planning meeting with the client a idea from the writer of the dialog came up that the application could potentially help children to read english better and educate them on the different animals found at the farm. I started a planning session with the client to conduct research into whether the surrounding community schools would be interested in doing outings to the farm for educational purposes.</p>	
				<p><span class="image left"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 3/Images/SchoolsQuestionarePieChart.png" alt=""/></span>Ashers farm sanctuary already had a good relationship with the community and schools located in the local area and this makes it much easier to contact schools to participate in a questionnaire for the application. The next sprint will be one week long and start right after the current. Sprint two will consist of building the questionnaire and getting it into the hands of the principles located in the community. The questions will be determined in a meeting set out mid week. Ashers farm sanctuary will be reaching out to the schools the coming week already. The potential of teaching using games are shown by research done on [2] Educational games as a motivational tool indicates that games can enhance learning outcomes. It states that users tend to view game-based learning at school with enthusiasm. As the use of entertainment games to help learning outcomes be achieved, there was research showing this is only achievable if both context and student are taken into consideration when the application is designed. We used the findings to help encourage schools to participate in the questionnaire and perhaps come visit the farm as a part of their lesson plans.</p>	
				<p>Development went well on the first sprint towards v.1.1 as I got the integration of the Blueprint Dialogs plugin working on first deployment. I have tested the plugin on Android API 26 and it functioned perfectly. I have started on the animation sequence tasks and should finish on time.</p>	
				<p>I could have taken a bit more time to sort out the content after integrating the Blueprint Dialog plugin. I had some issues understanding the content due to files not being sorted in their correct folders. Next time I integrate a plugin into the project I need to sort the files into the correct folders right from the start as then it would make the process of applying the new feature so much faster and less complicated to understand.</p>

					<h2><u>Week 4</u></h2>
					<h3><li>Colour Theory</li></h3>					
					<p>During this week I experimented with Colour as I set out the colour palette of the application based on an image picked out in a questionnaire we presented to Ashers Farm Sanctuary Followers over several days. I also experimented with colour composition as I mix the results together to create Illusions on colour  found from the single Image selected to represent the Animal Sanctuary. The image was one of five images presented and all images can be found in the Gallery on the Website.</p> 
					<a href="https://www.ashersfarmsanctuary.org/" class="button">Ashers Farm Sanctuary Website Link</a>
					<p></p>	
					<h3><li>Colour Palette</li></h3>
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 4/Images/Palettes_Image.png" alt=""></span>I generated a colour pallette for the application based on the image received from the questionnaire and found some similarities in the colours found. The colours feature a brown and dark palette. This can affect the applications immersion as indicated by a study [1] done on  “Regarding color psychology principles in adventure games to enhance the sense of immersion” done by Samad Roohi in 2019. It states that  players generally experience immersion by paying no attention to the surrounding events and that if the environment is in a well-designed form, graphic design elements can enhance the level of players involvement in a game.</p>	
					<p>Getting the player to immerse into the experience is a key aspect of the application. I want to blent the real with the unreal very closely to create an amazing experience for the clients and create an environment to learn. By applying the correct color and understanding my colour palette better in the future I can make all my applications more immersive. Exploring the different photos and colors in this experiment has taught me the importance of the relationship between colour and immersion.</p>

					<h3><li>Colour Composition</li></h3>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 4/Images/Ilution_1.png" alt=""></span>The Principles for making 3 colors look like 4…</p>
					<p>The experiment is driven by a study done by [2] UNSW school of Physics in Sydney Australia. In the experiment I mix and blend colours together to achieve more colours then are actively displayed on the screen.</p>
					<p>Three findings that I applied to my experiment to determine the amount of colours generated when combining them were as follows based on [3] 'Colour', How to use colour in art and design by Anderson Feiser.</p>
					<p>In the findings it states that

						A color surrounded by a darker color will appear to be lighter than it is–and–conversely, a color surrounded by a lighter color will appear to be darker than it is.
						A secondary or tertiary color surrounded by one of it’s parent colors will look more like the opposite parent.  e.g. brown surrounded by light brown looks Dark brown.
						A color surrounded by a duller version of the same hue will look brighter and–and–a color surrounded by a brighter version of the same hue will look duller.
						</p>
					<p>I do think that the experiment was of value. It was the first time I have played with colour and I have gained knowledge from generating the colour pallette of how to apply colour to my textures inside my application. The results found would drive the palette of all designs featured in the application moving forward.</p>
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 4/Images/Ilution_2.png" alt=""></span>I will need to adjust the GUI to match the colour pallette found. I want to have all the colours of the application sync up and match a specific palette so help make the application feel more polished and complete.</p>
					<p>[4] Rider, Rose M study on  "Color Psychology and Graphic Design Applications" states that cool hues are relaxants and generally preferred over their more arousing warm counterparts. I will remember to apply this to my GUI and settings to help sooth the player into the experience in the future. It also states that color can advance or devastate design effectiveness and have massive economic implications for companies and products when getting colour wrong in the application as users feel alienated or even disconnected with what they are experiencing. I want to avoid this in the future as one again immersion and engagement are of the utter most importance if the application was going to educate users and encourage learning through engagement.</p>
					<p></p>
					<h3><li>Sprint Planning</li></h3>
					<p>To integrate the colours into the current mvp would not take much time as I am able to utilize the Unreal Engine material editor to adjust colours and tints of the application. This was also applied using the Chameleon post process plugin to give a complete and finished feel to the app.</p>
					<a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/chameleon">Chameleon Unreal Engine 4 Marketplace Link</a>
					<p></p>
					<p>I would know I have reached my goal when I start to get a more complete feel in design. As the colours start to match, objects stand less out and scenes become complete and blend together. The changing of the current palate would be done in the next sprint and as I start working on the materials and objects begin to change and blend in colour  I would know that I am making progress.</p>
					<p>I have made materials and shaders reusable and thus don't have many in the application. This would make the task of changing the colour palette easy and quick in the Unreal Engine. I want to achieve this goal before the end of the next sprint as I would like the changes to take effect immediately to drive the rest of the design and development that needs to follow.</p>

					<h2><u>Week 5</u></h2>				
					<h3><li>Coronavirus Lockdowns South Africa</li></h3>			
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 5/Images/South-Africa-lockdown.webp" alt=""></span>Due to the Covid-19 virus spreading around the world and into South Africa where I stay, the country of SOon more. The lockdown poses hard challenges and no travel between provinces or shops are allowed to be open. No business except for essential services would be able to legally function and thus Ashers Farm sanctuary is forced to close down their doors for the remainder of the time till lockdown is lifted.</p>
					<p>This would mean that the application mvp v 1.2 live demo on the farm would need to be delayed till a later date this year. The schools have also shut down and communication with the teachers who took the questionnaire is basically impossible now. The writer who was doing the narrative has closed his business till further notice and won't be able to deliver on the text.</p>
					<p>As there will be no visitors to the Farm during this time, we are utilizing their Social Media presence by doing all the required questionnaires through facebook to help the project research moving forward and the design being more relevant.</p>
					<p>Due to all the barriers the applications' new narrative would not be able to develop as there is no text. I met with the client and we had a talk about other options for the app. We needed to give people something that they would be able to take home after visiting the farm as well as play from home when not able to visit.</p>
					<p>We designed the idea of an AR playpen where ar codes will provide different models for kids to play with in the real world. This would also keep kids busy at the Sanctuary Restaurant when Adults want to relax.</p>
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 5/Images/105890506-1556873307484cyrilramaphosasa.jpg" alt=""></span>Thanks to agile methodologies applied in the development of the application we can change direction and adapt to the current circumstances to put the app in the hands of the visitor from home. [1] Stefan H Thomke research on “managing development flexibility in uncertain environments” helped earlier on as indicated by *link chapter 1* design and approach choices.</p>
					<p>We will create different codes that represent the buildings and animals found in the sanctuary. As kids collect the cards they can view them through the application on their smartphone to reveal a 3D model on the card. This would be building blocks for users and visitors to build their own arm Sanctuary and also promote the farm from home.</p>
					<p>The mode would feature a donate option as well for people to donate from home and the banners and animals will be themed to those found on Ashers Farm Sanctuary. The cards can be collected at the restaurant or on promotion days to be able to build up your farm.</p>
					<p>I would need to build 3 models that I would like to use to demonstrate the idea. I want to do the barn as it is a centre piece to the farm. I also want to include the animals to see what they look like when placed on a table in front of the user to view. The third model I will be using is a tree to demonstrate vegetation options. The tree also has a significant meaning as it is a replica of the one found on the Farm where the ashes of the founder Oscar Asher Hirsch was left to rest.</p>
					<p>I would also need to adjust the AR platform to display the models on the cards I want to use. This won't be hard as I have completed the AR Core feature during the last module MVP. I want to achieve this goal by the end of the module and integrate it as a mode in the application for visitors to use at home with the AR cards.</p>
					<p>I know I have reached my goal when I have the tree 3d models displaying on the correct cards in front of me. This would put me in a good place to demonstrate the new updated MVP v 1.1. I do have extra cards with me that I have not used yet. I will be using the info cards for my image recognition as the stores where I print new cards will not be open for the lockdown.</p>
					
					<h3><li>Sprint Retrospective</li></h3>
					<p>I completed the colour palette change of the application during the last sprint and have found that objects blend better together and feel like they belong. Before objects felt like they stood out or were glued together.</p>
					<p>I also completed the UI layout and designs for the application. The designs were signed off by the client and development on the UI will begin during the next two weeks then the third sprint for this module starts.</p>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 5/Images/Flowchart_UI.jpg" alt=""></span>I really adjusted the colours of the application well. This was due to the Unreal Engine Shader editor ease of use. I also have extensive knowledge of the software and feel like I really demonstrated my knowledge well as it did not take long to complete. Designing the UI with the client went really well as we came to a conclusion on the designs very quickly. I explained the basic design and prototype for the UI well</p>
					<p>I could have given more attention to colour and composition in the future. I need to learn more about the Chameleon post process plugin for Unreal Engine as it really worked well in applying a polished feel to the application through post process tint effects.</p>
					<p>In designing the UI I did make mistakes when using Adobe XD to design the flow charts. In the future I can take some time and learn the software a lot better. By learning the software better I would be able to communicate with the client even more clearly with interactive demonstrations without having to develop a simple prototype to demonstrate the concept. This would reduce time quite a bit when planning UI and GUI in the future. To achieve this I need to find a course on Coursera for me to take on Adobe XD. This is the second time the software has come up in my studies and after this module I want to dedicate a month to taking a course 3 hours a day to get an intermediate understanding of the software.</p>

					<h3><u>Character Design</u></h3>
					<p>The client wanted to have a Mascot animal for the application that would represent the Ashers Farm Sanctuary name and voice. We worked together to list five animals that headline the farm and drew up a questionnaire to send out to clients via a newsletter.</p>
					<p>We sent out the questionnaire and received the results back.</p>
					<p></p>	
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 6/MascotQuestionarePieChart.png" alt=""></span></p>	
					<p></p>	
					<p>As I have already completed the Cow during the MVP I wanted to focus on backstory rather than look and feel. The model was well received during the MVP stages and featured the Cow as the mascot already for the Sanctuary.</p>
					<p>I had a meeting with the client to ask what they see the traits of their mascot being. Combining the feedback from the client and the research into [1] A methodology for “incorporating personality modeling in believable game characters” by Zammitto, Veronica & Dipaola, Steve & Arya, Ali.</p>
					<p>The study states that it is the particular combination of traits, qualities, and behaviors that makes a person unique. Implementing personality into characters requires operationalizing the abstract concept. We wanted to look at everything they stand for and represent to make sure they give out their message to the user through the character design.</p>
					<p>We decided that the Cow would be called Asher after the founder of the farm. Asher is a cow with a dream to save all his animal friends in the world. He works hard during the day to keep a safe haven for animals going. He enjoys making friends and teaching them about his friends. Asher is a compassionate loving character that values life and happiness above all things.</p>

					<h3><li>Sprint Planning</li></h3>
					<p>The next sprint will involve creating the playpen concept. I need to create a barn and Tree that would feature as pieces in the farm AR playpen. Due to the Corona virus lockdown in South Africa, I am not able to make new cards for the AR image recognition so I will use my info cards to demonstrate the concept for the module as place holders.  I need to change the data struts to feature the new models and set up the maps that need to run the AR scene in the app.</p>
					<p>I do believe I can accomplish these goals set out as I have done it before for AR applications. I will have achieved my goal when I can display the Barn, Tree and Animals on the AR Cards assigned to them. I will only be doing a one week sprint as the goal I have set out for myself is not unfamiliar to me. I will be able to commit to the goal as I have time off for paternity leave. This gives me time in the evenings to work on the sprint and achieve the goal within 6 hours.</p>

					<h2><u>Week 7</u></h2>
					<h3><li>Sound Design</li></h3>
					<p>I will be focusing on sound design and creation this week. In the module we were tasked at listing actions a user can take in the application. Of the listed actions I considered five of the most interesting ones and created a sound effect to represent them.</p>
					<p>The actions I chose was more focused on the sounds I would be able to use in the UI. I choose Application Start and Exit as the sounds would play when the user goes into a game mode or when exiting the application from the main menu. I would also be able to use the Application Start sound during the intro sequence.</p>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 7/images.jpg" alt=""></span>I also selected Change along with Correct and Incorrect. These would be very important sounds during the navigation of the Main Menu by the user. The Correct would be user when selecting an option and Incorrect when going back on a menu to the previous. Change would be played when the user moves from one option to another by sliding their finger up or down over the smartphone touch screen.</p>
					<p>As I am not very good in sound design and have not explored in the direction of sound much before. I looked for packages and plugins inside the unreal engine to help me with pre-created sound fx and the tools to modify them and make them my own for the application. I was looking for a specific tone for my sound fx. I read up on sound fx and the study of 'Informative sound design in video games' by Patrick Ng and Keith Nesbitt which states the importance of sound conveying the action being taken and the aesthetic must correlate to the overall theme and style of the app.</p>
					<p>This would help with immersion as users will feel more connected with the sound from familiar environments they experience every day. It will make the application and experience more believable as indicated by the study.</p>
					<p>My list of sounds I choose with link to clip found below:</p>
					<p>Application Start
						Application Exit
						Correct
						Incorrect
						Change
						</p>

						<span class="image right"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 7/business-advantage.jpg" alt=""></span>
					<p>I have always known how important the correct sound for a game is as some of my favorite and memorable sounds in my life come from video games and good design around the theme and the application. By creating the sounds and taking the time to find the correct fx for the Ashers Farm Sanctuary application has taught me more about the process of sound design and creation. It was interesting to experience the process for myself for the first time.</p>
					<p>In the future I would take more time to focus on the sound fx myself before getting a sound engineer involved. It helps me to understand the application theme better as well as the entire process of application development. I will achieve this goal by getting involved with Sound Engineering at work a bit more. I work with very talented sound engineers that develop music and sounds for the games we produce in the studio. I would like to achieve this goal by the start of the positioning stages of the current version of the application.</p>
					<p>I will know that I reached my goal once I can create and find sounds and audio that fits the theme of what I want to do in a shorter amount of time. This would also increase my communication skills with the sound engineers by having more of an understanding of what they do. My indicator of progress will be the new version of the application as the audio quality increases by correlating better with the overall theme.</p>
					<p>The goal I have set out is reachable due to the resources I have at work. Getting involved with audio in the studio will be easy as I can take 1 hour a week to go have a conversation with the sound engineers and learn more about what and how they do things.</p>

					<h2><u>Week 10</u></h2>
					<h3><li>3D Asset Creation</li></h3>
					<p>This week I created a 3D Icon for the application. I wanted something that could act as a placeholder till we develop the final product. It would help us think about the brand and how we want to represent Ashers Farm Sanctuary online a bit more as well as give a more polished feel to the application when it starts up.</p>

					<h3><li>Sprint Planning</li></h3>
					<p>The final sprint I want to do is mostly based on polish. I want to apply my new found knowledge of colour to the application and see if I can get the MVP v1.2 down to a bug free state.I will be playtesting the application throughout the week for about 1 hour a day to see if I can find bugs. If I find the bugs I will address the low priority first and log the high priority to be fixed the next morning before testing starts. I will be logging the bugs on the trello board of the application and will complete them one by one as they come in. I will be playing testing the application on a Samsung S7 edge device using the cards I have with me at home to test the models and AR.</p>
					<p>I want to give a complete bug free experience to the client so that they will have the confidence to continue development with me in the future.</p>
