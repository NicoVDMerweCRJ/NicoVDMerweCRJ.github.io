					<h2><u>Week 1</u></h2>
					<h3><li>Game Design</li></h3>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 1/Images/UnrealLogo.jpg" alt=""/></span>I have been working on an AR project from the Live Brief Design and Development module. I received a brief from Ashers Farm Sanctuary to help develop an app that would help increase donations, help with staff shortages and engagement with the animals on the farm. The brief led to an app being developed called the Ashers Farm Sanctuary Smart Guide that helps the visitors experience the farm through an AR driven environment. </p>							
					<p>The app provided a digital tour to visitors that would also help educate them on the stories of the animals along with direct access to donations during the tour. The tour consisted of a physical marker in the form of an Image card that can be located in front of each animal's pen. When the image is scanned by the visitor, information about the animal in the pen along with donation options would appear in AR that would encourage donations and education via your smartphone.</p>
					<p>Research was done on the farm in the form of questionnaires answered by visitors to the farm. This research determined the most common operating system used on smartphones along with the average visitor age.</p>
					<p>The visitor age research conducted defined the look and feel of the models made for the application. Due to the younger age group the animals were given a toon feel rather than realistic. The other research conducted drove the platform of choice and technology stack that would be implemented during the development.</p>
					<p>The app was tested on the farm by visitors and received an overwhelmingly positive response. The client was very happy and the MVP was a success.</p>
					
					<h3><li>Individual Project Ideas</li></h3>
					<p>I have decided to continue developing the application during this module. I will be involved with Ashes Farm Sanctuary again this module to gain research towards the development and design direction of the application.</p>
					<p>During the development of the application this module I would like to implement a dialog system to the application so that the 3D models can communicate with the visitors and develop a dialog. This would be story driven like found in video games such as Mass Effect and would encourage engagement by the visitors by also featuring a small minigame where they get to feed the animal in the application. The farm itself becomes the playground and the story can help educate visitors on the animals and tell the story of the sanctuary and their vision. This holds a big advantage when it comes to educating visitors. XXXXXX Engaging naretive teaches better XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p>
					<p>This goal will be achieved using the Unreal Engine and ARCore technologies along with the MVP I have already built and tested. I would like to achieve this goal by the end of this module and replicate the design from a single pen seamlessly to eight others. I would like to achieve this goal to be able to turn the farm into a digital AR flipbook that blends with reality while solving the problems that Ashers Farm Sanctuary face.</p>
					<p>Implementing the naterive would not be too complicated. I am using the plugin Blueprint DIalogs for the Unreal Engine to implement my dialogs into the application. By using this plugin it would help me quickly implement dialog and also leave room for voice over at a later stage. The dialogs will be written by Ashers Farm Sanctuary who has received a donation by a children's book writer to conduct the dialogs for the app.</p>
					<p>I will know I have reached this goal when the application can tell a small story at a location and provide interactive dialogs to the user. This will include a small mini game that will encourage interaction with the real world pen by the user to determine answers to questions.</p>
					<p>I will know that I am moving forward when I see my sprints that are set out completed on time and the application taking shape as the animals' dialogs appear. This can be achieved due to the stability of the MVP developed in the previous module. I already have all the models and animations and need to put everything together and integrate the dialog system which I am familiar with already and have integrated into projects in the past.</p>
					<p>Given the time set out for the project to be completed I do believe I have enough time. I will be breaking the project down into sprints which will drive the development of the project. This leaves room for change and flexibility by using Agile Methodologies to drive development XXXXXXXXXXX</p>

					<h3><li>Sprint Planning</li></h3>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 1/Images/UIMainMenuDesignFlowChart.jpg" alt="" /></span>For my next sprint in the development of the Ashers Farm Sanctuary Guide Application I will be integrating the dialog plugin. I will also be prepping the dialog system to receive the text from the writer and start developing the sequences that animations should follow when the story is told. I would like to complete the welcome stage where the character walks in and a dialog appears that welcomes the player to the pen and encourages them to explore the pen further.</p>	
					<p>The sprint will take place over two weeks and will be monitored on Trello where I have been working with the Applications past sprints conducted up to release 1.01 of the application.</p>

					<h2><u>Week 2</u></h2>
					<h3><li>Fictional Worlds & Game Mechanics</li></h3>			
					<p>In week two of the module I was given an exercise to Create a game. The brief asked me to imagine how you could build a game based on the character's everyday life when it suddenly takes a dramatic turn while the situation changes suddenly and the person is forced to step up and go beyond what they thought was humanly possible. Luckily, they have your trusty app to give them extra superpowers.</p>
					<p>XXXXXXXXXXX Persona Image</p>
					<h4><li>Mechanics</li></h4>	
					<p>Point and click adventure game filled with puzzles. The puzzles consist of bringing images to life or drawing new ones to enter the world to overcome obstacles in the characters life.</p>
					<h4><li>Summery</li></h4>	
					<p>David Muller is an Illustrator that takes life day by day. He is always on time for work and leaves at exactly the right moment. He works for a Game Development company and his day is mainly made up of drawing Illustrations of Characters that will be integrated into video games developed by the company.</p>
					<p>During one normal day, David finishes work and heads over to his car. As he reaches the door of the vehicle he notices that someone broke into his car. As David sighs and starts looking around for what the thieves took. He hears a voice telling him to turn around. Two thieves hold him up with a knife and force his wallet and keys out of his pocket.</p>
					<p>As David tried to stop them his bag with his drawings fell to the ground and the drawings started to come alive. As the characters of his dark mind tore the thieves limb from limb he realised that he has been granted the ability to bring creations to life.</p>
					<p>As the burglars lay lifeless on the ground the characters go back into the page and become drawings again. With his new found ability he sets out to experience life with his new found ability.</p>
					<h4><li>Deliverable</li></h4>	
					<p>The app is made for smartphones and Nintendo switch. The app will feature the first episode in the story of David Muller, the app developer from Cape Town. The first chapter will deliver a single boss at the end as well as 3 hours worth of content to drive the story. It will release at a reduced price to kick start the series.</p>
					<h3><li<p></p>>Sprint Retrospective</li></h3>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 2/Images/perforce-logo.png" alt="" /></span>During a planning meeting with the client a idea from the writer of the dialog came up that the application could potentially help children to read english better and educate them on the different animals found at the farm. I started a planning session with the client to conduct research into whether the surrounding community schools would be interested in doing outings to the farm for educational purposes.</p>
					<p>Ashers farm sanctuary already had a good relationship with the community and schools located in the local area and this makes it much easier to contact schools to participate in a questionnaire for the application. The next sprint will be one week long and start right after the current. Sprint two will consist of building the questionnaire and getting it into the hands of the principles located in the community. The questions will be determined in a meeting set out mid week. Ashers farm sanctuary will be reaching out to the schools the coming week already. The potential of teaching using games are shown at XXXXXXXXXXX.and we will be using this to help encourage schools to participate in the questionnaire and perhaps come visit the farm as a part of their lesson plans.</p>
					<p>Development went well on the first sprint towards v.1.1 as I got the integration of the Blueprint Dialogs plugin working on first deployment. I have tested the plugin on Android API 26 and it functioned perfectly. I have started on the animation sequence tasks and should finish on time.</p>
					<p>I could have taken a bit more time to sort out the content after integrating the Blueprint Dialog plugin. I had some issues understanding the content due to files not being sorted in their correct folders. Next time I integrate a plugin into the project I need to sort the files into the correct folders right from the start as then it would make the process of applying the new feature so much faster and less complicated to understand.</p>

					<h3><u>Character Design</u></h3>
					<p>The client wanted to have a Mascot animal for the application that would represent the Ashers Farm Sanctuary name and voice. We worked together to list five animals that headline the farm and drew up a questionnaire to send out to clients via a newsletter.</p>
					<p>We set out the questionnaire and received the results back.</p>
					<p>Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx image of charts</p>
					<p>As I have already completed the Cow during the MVP I wanted to focus on backstory rather than look and feel. The model was well received during the MVP stages and featured the Cow as the mascot already for the Sanctuary.</p>
					<p>I had a meeting with the client to ask what they see the traits of their mascot being. Combinging the feedback from the client and the research into XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Veronica_Zammitto/publication/228347244_A_methodology_for_incorporating_personality_modeling_in_believable_game_characters/links/09e4150d07dfee0752000000/A-methodology-for-incorporating-personality-modeling-in-believable-game-characters.pdf</p>
					<p>The study states that it is the particular combination of traits, qualities, and behaviors that makes a person unique. Implementing personality into characters requires to operationalize the abstract concept. This means to breakdown Design Environment Face Engine (same API but separately implemented for PC and Game Console) Face UI Run-time Environment (PC and/or Game Console) personality into measurable variables that show specific observations.</p>
					<p>We decided that the Cow would be called Asher after the founder of the farm. Asher is a cow with a dream to save all his animal friends in the world. He works hard during the day to keep a safe haven for animals going. He enjoys making friends and teaching them about his friends. Asher is a compassionate loving character that values life and happiness above all things.</p>

					<h3><li>Sprint Review</li></h3>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 4/Images/Pathfinding.jpg" alt=""></span>Reflecting upon the App jam of week three I noticed that I did apply some of the practices involved in Agile development.  I found the practice of Extreme programming (XP) as I applied the planning game and simple design characteristics during my design phase and refactoring continuous integration along with coding standards in my development phase of the app jam. As issues in the application arose, I found myself using Pragmatic programming methods as thinking solutions instead of excuses, Fix bugs and issues as you see them, introducing change where you feel it is necessary to help me face the barriers ahead and overcome them.			
					<p>I do believe I can accomplish these goals set out as I have done it before for AR applications. I will have achieved my goal when I can display the Barn, Tree and Animals on the AR Cards assigned to them. I will only be doing a one week sprint as the goal I have set out for myself is not unfamiliar to me. I will be able to commit to the goal as I have time off for paternity leave. This gives me time in the evenings to work on the sprint and achieve the goal within 6 hours.</p>

					<h2><u>Week 7</u></h2>
					<h3><li>Sound Design</li></h3>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 7/business-advantage.jpg" alt=""></span>I set out a Sprint goal for myself this week.  My Sprint goal is to make a functioning prototype of the User Interface (UI) for my AR application. Achieving this goal, I will be using Gimp to make textures. I will also use the Unreal Engine’s Widget and blueprint systems to do layout and development. Having this goal achieved and the UI setup will not only get me to start thinking about design around UX, it will also provide me with a tool to use during debugging while developing features by letting me reset and debug during runtime. This will save me time on development by helping to find bugs in my application.</p>
					<p>The functionality of the UI will be minimal and will consist of 5 buttons. A menu button will be included on the General User Interface (GUI).  The UI will consist of menu, back, start and quit buttons that provide the basic functionality to the user. I will know that my sprint goal is achieved when I can start, exit and reset my application using a UI at runtime on my mobile device. I will use my AR application Trello board to track my progress and time. I have setup a Sprint task that contains my current sprint goal as a Card and tasks that need to be completed and time spent that will help me keep track of the time limit using checklists.</p>
					<p>My backlog list of items to achieve the sprint goal is arranged from high priority to low priority. Creating button textures and doing the layout will be high priority as I will need to have these items completed before I can prototype the UI. This shouldn’t take more than 2 hours as I will use gimp to create a single button to use across the UI and add text and do my layout inside Unreal Engine using widgets.</p>
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 7/header-front-end-development.png" alt=""></span><p>Next on the list is developing the functionality to the UI and should take no longer than 3 hours. During the development of the UI functionality continuous testing will occur inside the editor. The final task of my sprint goal is physical device testing. This process should not take longer than 1 hour as continuous testing during development should help produce no errors or bugs.</p>
					<p>I have set the sprint time limit to 2 weeks and limited the hours spent to 4 hours per week. This would be enough time to complete the tasks that need to be done and complete the sprint goal as I have done UI prototyping before using the Unreal Engine.  The total of 6 hours it should take to complete my tasks set out will leave me with 2 hours for new tasks and problems that arise making the sprint goal achievable within the 8-hour limit. All tasks of the sprint could change during development. As new tasks arise, I will add them and include priority while considering the time limit and the final goal I want to achieve.</p>

					<h2><u>Week 8</u></h2>	
					<h3><li>Sound Process</li></h3>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 8/BarryOvereem11Advatanges.jpg" alt=""></span>I started to take new direction with my application this week as I complete my sprint goal I set out for myself. I started doing research into applications that could help me achieve my goal of planning out the UI before developing and implementing it into my application.</p>	
					<p>I chose Adobe XD for its Responsive Resize feature that automatically adjusts and sizes images as and layouts of my boards to screen sizes. This feature helps my UI stay flexible and responsive as well as the ability to adapt and scale to the different mobile screen sizes available. Adobe XD also works very well in prototyping the UI by wireframing and creating simple interactive click through prototypes. This helps me track the flow of my UI and design smart around functionality. </p>	
					<p>I found using Adobe XD quite hard due to the workflow being so much different from other software I am used to using like Maya and the Unreal Engine. I found tutorials at  https://helpx.adobe.com/africa/xd/tutorials.html done by the adobe team that I could follow to get myself doing the basics. </p>	
					<p>During the process of making my boards I found that not only do I have a lack of understanding around planning UI design and creating prototypes, but learning this skill and applying it using Adobe XD will require me to learn more about the program itself and designs done by others.</p>	
					<p>Investing time into Adobe XD will help me learn an important skill I require for application development in the future. I need to learn to plan and create my UI and UX designs inside Adobe XD. I will also need to start looking at other UI designs and learn from the problems they faced developing for the different applications and platforms available on the market. </p>	
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 8/goal.jpg" alt=""></span>I will achieve these goals by continuing to view at least two tutorials a week from https://helpx.adobe.com/africa/xd/tutorials.html and build my knowledge of how to use Adobe XD to its full potential and create my own prototypes and designs for application I want to design in the future. I also want to take 60 minutes a week to explore interesting UI designs done by other AR applications on the market. This will help me grow my knowledge of different UI, what challenges they faced and how to overcome them using design that is flexible and adaptive.</p>	
					<p>I want to be able to design and create prototypes of my own UI design by the end of this module. I’m not aiming to be a professional in the field of Adobe XD and UI prototyping, but to be able to create a basic design, plan and UI layout. Understanding this process will help me plan future applications UI accurately and make the development process much easier and leave me with less roadblocks and issues that may arise from a lack of planning ahead.</p>	
					<p>I know I have achieved this goal set out when I am able to create and prototype my UI ideas inside Adobe XD without having to look at tutorials for help. It will also be a clear indicator that I have achieved what I set out to do when I refer to my Adobe XD designs with more details and functionality documented rather than my simple drawings and basic planning as before.</p>	 
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 8/Adobe-XD-free.jpg" alt=""></span>By following the tutorials and lessons provided by Adobe on XD I can achieve this goal within the time set out. In two weeks, I want to have a simple example of my UI completed in Adobe XD and make sure to continue to add to it as it grows in complexity. I want to have a basic UI layout completed in four weeks that I can follow to improve my UI prototype as it stands.</p>

					<h2><u>Week 9</u></h2>
					<h3><li>Sound Design Case Studies</li></h3>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 9/1_vzCPKrGqBtZ0NLeDb08X7Q.jpeg" alt=""></span>After reading the Articles Sprint Planning Meeting and Task Boards I created a new Trello board that focuses specifically on my sprints to help me keep track of what I want to achieve and how I want to do so. For my new sprints goal, I created a user story to keep me aligned with what I need to achieve while keeping the way I achieve the goal agile and flexible. My user story is as follows “As a user, I want to be able to see what my backyard would look like if it was covered in grass”. </p>
					<p>To accomplish this goal, I have created lists inside my new Sprint Trello board. These include Story, To Do, In Process, To Verify and Done. What I want to accomplish is to be able to take a floor area and detect its surface using my ARX project and have the user place grass on the area.  I want to achieve this goal within two weeks and have set aside three hours a week for my sprint. </p>
					<p>I want to achieve this goal as it will start the main functionality of changing surfaces and environments. This is the main functionality of my application and will provide me with a simple framework to build on and extend my library of surfaces and object that can be placed in the user’s surroundings.</p>
					<div align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gll5-kXyq58" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
					<p></p>	
					<p>I will know I have achieved my sprint goal when I am able to change a detected surface material to soil as well as place grass on top of the soil using a basic library UI on a physical device using my ARX application. This goal is achievable due to the past UI and surface detection sprints that I completed successfully in weeks six and seven. The UI sprint of week seven has made it simple for me to add new UI functions quickly and my surface detection sprint of week six gave me accurate surface detection and made it possible to place objects and change materials of the surface detection grid created when surfaces are detected in my ARX Application.</p>
					<p>I can commit to the three hours a week for two weeks as I will dedicate one and a half hours at the end of my day on Tuesdays and Thursdays to complete the sprint goal. Using my new Trello board for my sprint I will track my progress and time spent to assure I stay within the time, scope and in alignment with the user story I set out. </p>
					<p>Moving and completing cards in my To Do list will provide me with an indication of progress as I will move cards created from To Do into my In Process and finally on completion into Done Lists in Trello. Cards also have checklists assigned to them to help me plan my approach and see what needs to be done for the specific task set out.</p>
					<p>I have started my sprint during the planning phase that happened on Thursday 1st of August and will complete the goal by 11th of August. I have built UI library systems before and with the UI base I have completed in my earlier sprints, I will be able to quickly add new functionality and expand into a library containing materials and objects.</p>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 9/input_devices.png" alt=""></span>I know I can complete this quickly as I will keep it simple and only do one object and one material the user can place. I already have a ground material with textures and low poly mobile friendly grass that can be used in the sprint and have already set up my touch inputs to be able to instantiate objects on the surface of my grid created by my ARX application surface detection.I am very excited to start creating some simple inputs for the user to interact with the environment around them using my ARX application.</p>
					
					<h3><li>Sprint Review</li></h3>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 4/Images/Pathfinding.jpg" alt=""></span>Reflecting upon the App jam of week three I noticed that I did apply some of the practices involved in Agile development.  I found the practice of Extreme programming (XP) as I applied the planning game and simple design characteristics during my design phase and refactoring continuous integration along with coding standards in my development phase of the app jam. As issues in the application arose, I found myself using Pragmatic programming methods as thinking solutions instead of excuses, Fix bugs and issues as you see them, introducing change where you feel it is necessary to help me face the barriers ahead and overcome them.			
					<p>During the app jam I did practice Agile methods but didn't always focus on all the characteristics equally and didn't see how it all comes together. In my continuation of the app jam project across the study block I will apply Extreme programming core values when thinking about design and creating new features for my applications as it grows in complexity.

					<h2><u>Week 10</u></h2>
					<h3><li>3D Asset Creation</li></h3>
					<p>After my Sprint goal of the past few weeks and setting everything up for my project management around Agile practices, I started doing my User Personas and found a big issue with my application. I don't believe it is very relevant in the industry and I am also not sure why I am developing it. The bigger picture is around designing your home and helping you better visualize your surroundings in a new way, but I feel my features that I have created doesn't really align very well with the bigger picture of my app.</p>
					<p>So, in the end I have decided to scrap my AR application. I have learned a lot about using Unreal in an AR environment and mobile development. I also discovered my lack of project management, UX/UI design and Market Research. These are obstacles I will need to overcome in the future to become a successful Creative App Developer. I will be righting about my obstacles in the and challenges in the upcoming Report on Continuing Personal and Professional Development as well as how I will overcome them.</p>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 10/effective-rapid-prototyping-diagram.jpg" alt=""></span>Moving forward I have decided to use Unity for my mobile development as I want to be able to rapid prototype and deploy to mobile for fast testing cycles [Reference 2]. Being able to deliver quick prototypes for testing will help my application chance of success in the long run as features developed can receive feedback quickly that can help me adjust what I am doing to keep the application on track with what my user wants instead of what I think would work [Reference 1].</p>
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 10/download.png" alt=""></span>Failing to receive feedback early in the development process will lead to long periods of time where features are developed with no real understanding of their relevancy and development that fluctuates very little with low contribute to knowledge flowing slowly between users and development teams [Reference 1]. This also leads to long cycles between getting new information of features required by users that would have been more relevant to the experience.</p>
					<p>To achieve this, I will need to understand the new features that has been introduced into Unity specifically around rapid prototyping. I will need to dedicate two hours a week to learn the new features that have been included in Unity 3D specific to rapid prototyping for mobile devices. I will know I have achieved this when I start to see features being prototyped successfully in a shorter amount of time during sprints and regular development leaving me with quick feedback from peers and users to improve my application. </p>

I found the practice of Extreme programming (XP) as I applied the planning game and simple design characteristics during my design phase and refactoring continuous integration along with coding standards in my development phase of the app jam. As issues in the application arose, I found myself using Pragmatic programming methods as thinking solutions instead of excuses, Fix bugs and issues as you see them, introducing change where you feel it is necessary to help me face the barriers ahead and overcome them.			
				<p>During the app jam I did practice Agile methods but didn't always focus on all the characteristics equally and didn't see how it all comes together. In my continuation of the app jam project across the study block I will apply Extreme programming core values when thinking about design and creating new features for my applications as it grows in complexity.
