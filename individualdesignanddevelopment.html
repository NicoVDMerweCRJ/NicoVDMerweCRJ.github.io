					<h2><u>Week 1</u></h2>
					<h3><li>Game Design</li></h3>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 1/Images/UnrealLogo.jpg" alt=""/></span>My research into my project idea posted for week 1 was centered around the Unreal Engine and how to integrate AR Core features in an application. I found a QuickStart guide to ARCore at <a href="https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/unreal/quickstart"> Unreal Quickstart</a> and followed the guide lines provided by Google and the team at Unreal.</p>							
					<p>My findings where that it was simple to set up the Plugin inside the unreal environment and load a template to play around with and deploy to my testing device. The setup for mobile inside Unreal was a straightforward setup and deployment to mobile was easy and quick.</p>
					
					
					<h3><li>Individual Project Ideas</li></h3>
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 1/Images/ARCore.png" alt="" /></span>I will use the Unreal 4.22 engine to design the application and utilize blueprint and C++ for development. I choose Android (26 - Oreo and up) as my platform of choice for this project as it supports Vulkan and Google ARcore which are two core plugins/tools I plan to use. My compiler will be Visual Studio 2018 and all code will be compiled from source code of the Unreal Engine as it will be required during plugin integration.</p>
					<p>I want to integrate AR into the application and provide a feature where the user can place the fish tank on any surface in a real-world location and then interact with your fish. I will implement this feature using Google ARcore technology that comes as a plugin with the Unreal Engine.</p>
					<p> All design documents are located to view in the link below:

					<p></p>
				
					<h3><li>Sprint Planning</li></h3>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 1/Images/UIMainMenuDesignFlowChart.jpg" alt="" /></span>I have an idea for an application to that I feel fits into the theme of "As long as we have each other, we will never run out of problems".</p>	
					<p>The application will tell the story of two fish living together in a fish tank. You have control of one fish called Bob and need to stay alive for as long as you can while challenges arise throughout your day. The entire application takes place in one fish tank so minimal assets are required. The focus will be on your interactions with the fish your control.</p>

					<h2><u>Week 4</u></h2>
					<h3><li>Colour Theory</li></h3>					
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 4/Images/Agile.png" alt=""></span>This week covered reflection and I looked at how Agile software development principles could have been applied to my app jam application. I have worked in Agile development environments for the past few years and do believe in the practices applied such as scrum and being sprint focused. I have seen amazing new ideas come out of doing sprints as well as solutions to big problems that improved projects greatly. Sprints have given me the opportunity in the past to explore new options and grow my skills and creativity by rapidly prototyping new ideas.</p> 
					<p>Reading up on agile software development I discovered many methods and ways of applying agile in my correct development. I found two practices I am going to take forward into my upcoming projects to help me achieve my outcomes and goals in both design and development.</p>
					<p>In Juhani Warsta, Pekka Abrahamsson, Outi Salo and Jussi Ronkainen peer-reviewed academic literature paper on Agile Software Development Methods I stumbled upon an agile practice I found very interesting that would help me think about design more efficiently. In section 3.7 Adaptive Software Development they describe different Agile methods of which I focused on the section 3.9.2 Pragmatic Programming method. </p>
					
					<h3><li>Colour Wheel</li></h3>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 4/Images/Pathfinding.jpg" alt=""></span>Reflecting upon the App jam of week three I noticed that I did apply some of the practices involved in Agile development.  I found the practice of Extreme programming (XP) as I applied the planning game and simple design characteristics during my design phase and refactoring continuous integration along with coding standards in my development phase of the app jam. As issues in the application arose, I found myself using Pragmatic programming methods as thinking solutions instead of excuses, Fix bugs and issues as you see them, introducing change where you feel it is necessary to help me face the barriers ahead and overcome them.			
					<p>During the app jam I did practice Agile methods but didn't always focus on all the characteristics equally and didn't see how it all comes together. In my continuation of the app jam project across the study block I will apply Extreme programming core values when thinking about design and creating new features for my applications as it grows in complexity.

					<h3><li>Concept Art</li></h3>			
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 5/Images/social-media-apps-2-shutterstock-650.jpg" alt=""></span>This week I completed my pathfinding for my fish and made a particle effect to solve my food issue. I learned from my faults of my previous practices in the App Jam and I started to do continuous build iterations and run my project on a physical device as soon as I had a feature completed. I ran my application on my Android s7 edge, and my application ran perfectly with no errors and a high frame rate.</p>	 
					<p>I need to work on my design and time management around d my project as I discovered l my personal case study, I did on my app jam. This was also made clear to me with my reflection of week 4, as I learned about Agile development and what solutions there are to overcome this barrier.</p>	
					<p>I had stopped everything I was doing on the application and looked at my planning and design and how to improve project and time management using Trello and the Timesheet time management tool. I also started thinking more about why I am creating some features and what meaning they hold in my application. I created a Trello board for me to manage my goals and time better and looked at what I wanted to achieve and how to get there being agile and flexible in my project management.</p>	
					<p>I looked at where my application fits into the many types of apps found in the marketplaces. I did this to know and understand where my idea’s fit into the industry and if they are relevant to what people would want to use. I see my app as gamification. Although my current design isn’t final and the features, I am working on currently can be used in many different designs. I have always seen my application being built around AR technologies that the Unreal game engine provide to solve a real-world problem by educating users on issues and solutions, as well as making them experience the world around them in new interactive ways.</p>	
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 5/Images/flat-thinking-concept_23-2148163823.jpg" alt=""></span>I need to go back and make sure things are on the right path by rethinking my scope and design of around my application. I also need to take a serious look at how my application fits into the market and if it really holds any value to the clients I intent to use my application. I want to have all my trello boards set up and ready accompanied with goals and ideas that follow my newly learned agile principles as well as a plan on how I am going to integrate all these agile practices into my future development.</p>	
					<p>I know I have achieved my goal of being more agile in my planning and development when I don’t need to think about what to do next as my trello board reflect my project goals and future features that need to be implemented. This would be possible to achieve by starting my week with an hour of project time to reflect on what needs to be done next and managing how I will be achieving this goal. I will set aside one hour on a Sunday to view my tasks for the next week and setup my trello boards accordingly.</p>	
					<p>I have also completed my draft copy this week of my short comings I discovered during the app jam and will present them next week on my personal case study. I decided to focus on agile and time management objectives and cover the failures I had during the App Jam around project management.</p>

					<h2><li>Week 6</li></h2>			
					<h3><u>Character Design</u></h3>
					<p>My sprint goals have mostly consisted development tasks for of my AR application prototype, but after the personal case study I started improving my approach on projects and management by using tools like trello to manage my project and study tasks. I am happy with the approach I took in creating my boards on trello for both the Individual Design and Development module and my AR project. I started populating the boards with tasks and goals that I planned out and felt the impact on time management immediately as I had clear goals now laid out and I knew what to achieve.</p>	
					<p>I could have included and tracked my research in my trello boards as I found myself finding tutorials that where relevant to Unreal Engine AR Blueprints and not documenting the links and made it hard to return to the tutorial later to review what was done. I need to start creating a tutorial lists and add cards to track tutorials I find relevant to design and development. I will create Tutorial new, viewed and implemented lists that will hold all tutorials viewed. I will also need to comment on the card viewed.</p>	
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 6/destination-1285851_1280.png" alt=""></span>I need to stop taking on too many tasks at once and focus on one thing at a time. I tend to take on multiple tasks at once and jump between them as I get time. This led to time being wasted and running out as bringing myself up to speed with what I did days before took up some time and made me rush things in the end leaving no time for proper testing on physical devices to ensure the feature works as intended. Focusing on completing a single task at a time will help me complete tasks within my time constraints and test new features before release. </p>	
					<p>Setting up my trello boards have helped me focus on one task at a time that has given me a new direction I want to take my AR app idea in. During development on AR surface detection I discovered a better way of detecting surfaces by following tutorials on youtube provided by dev_enabled at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL1jcpKRApOp_CkW9LkFRKA . I implemented the new feature improvements and found I was detecting surfaces more accurately then the default ARHandheld template offered by the Unreal Engine. I have started experimenting with placing grass on the floor as you walk and turned my living room into a forest. All this was done on extra time I had left after completing my task. This is all time that was made by focus and planning.</p>	
					<p>I need to keep adding cards to lists on trello to continue my development and time management. As soon as I design something, I need to keep adding cards to trello with comments that include references to other relevant lists on the board. This has helped me with time management the past few weeks as I found myself having more time to test features regularly and fix the problem immediately as it arises leaving me with better milestone builds with less bugs and more time for the next milestone to be achieved.</p>

					<h2><u>Week 7</u></h2>
					<h3><li>Sound Design</li></h3>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 7/business-advantage.jpg" alt=""></span>I set out a Sprint goal for myself this week.  My Sprint goal is to make a functioning prototype of the User Interface (UI) for my AR application. Achieving this goal, I will be using Gimp to make textures. I will also use the Unreal Engine’s Widget and blueprint systems to do layout and development. Having this goal achieved and the UI setup will not only get me to start thinking about design around UX, it will also provide me with a tool to use during debugging while developing features by letting me reset and debug during runtime. This will save me time on development by helping to find bugs in my application.</p>
					<p>The functionality of the UI will be minimal and will consist of 5 buttons. A menu button will be included on the General User Interface (GUI).  The UI will consist of menu, back, start and quit buttons that provide the basic functionality to the user. I will know that my sprint goal is achieved when I can start, exit and reset my application using a UI at runtime on my mobile device. I will use my AR application Trello board to track my progress and time. I have setup a Sprint task that contains my current sprint goal as a Card and tasks that need to be completed and time spent that will help me keep track of the time limit using checklists.</p>
					<p>My backlog list of items to achieve the sprint goal is arranged from high priority to low priority. Creating button textures and doing the layout will be high priority as I will need to have these items completed before I can prototype the UI. This shouldn’t take more than 2 hours as I will use gimp to create a single button to use across the UI and add text and do my layout inside Unreal Engine using widgets.</p>
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 7/header-front-end-development.png" alt=""></span><p>Next on the list is developing the functionality to the UI and should take no longer than 3 hours. During the development of the UI functionality continuous testing will occur inside the editor. The final task of my sprint goal is physical device testing. This process should not take longer than 1 hour as continuous testing during development should help produce no errors or bugs.</p>
					<p>I have set the sprint time limit to 2 weeks and limited the hours spent to 4 hours per week. This would be enough time to complete the tasks that need to be done and complete the sprint goal as I have done UI prototyping before using the Unreal Engine.  The total of 6 hours it should take to complete my tasks set out will leave me with 2 hours for new tasks and problems that arise making the sprint goal achievable within the 8-hour limit. All tasks of the sprint could change during development. As new tasks arise, I will add them and include priority while considering the time limit and the final goal I want to achieve.</p>

					<h2><u>Week 8</u></h2>	
					<h3><li>Sound Process</li></h3>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 8/BarryOvereem11Advatanges.jpg" alt=""></span>I started to take new direction with my application this week as I complete my sprint goal I set out for myself. I started doing research into applications that could help me achieve my goal of planning out the UI before developing and implementing it into my application.</p>	
					<p>I chose Adobe XD for its Responsive Resize feature that automatically adjusts and sizes images as and layouts of my boards to screen sizes. This feature helps my UI stay flexible and responsive as well as the ability to adapt and scale to the different mobile screen sizes available. Adobe XD also works very well in prototyping the UI by wireframing and creating simple interactive click through prototypes. This helps me track the flow of my UI and design smart around functionality. </p>	
					<p>I found using Adobe XD quite hard due to the workflow being so much different from other software I am used to using like Maya and the Unreal Engine. I found tutorials at  https://helpx.adobe.com/africa/xd/tutorials.html done by the adobe team that I could follow to get myself doing the basics. </p>	
					<p>During the process of making my boards I found that not only do I have a lack of understanding around planning UI design and creating prototypes, but learning this skill and applying it using Adobe XD will require me to learn more about the program itself and designs done by others.</p>	
					<p>Investing time into Adobe XD will help me learn an important skill I require for application development in the future. I need to learn to plan and create my UI and UX designs inside Adobe XD. I will also need to start looking at other UI designs and learn from the problems they faced developing for the different applications and platforms available on the market. </p>	
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 8/goal.jpg" alt=""></span>I will achieve these goals by continuing to view at least two tutorials a week from https://helpx.adobe.com/africa/xd/tutorials.html and build my knowledge of how to use Adobe XD to its full potential and create my own prototypes and designs for application I want to design in the future. I also want to take 60 minutes a week to explore interesting UI designs done by other AR applications on the market. This will help me grow my knowledge of different UI, what challenges they faced and how to overcome them using design that is flexible and adaptive.</p>	
					<p>I want to be able to design and create prototypes of my own UI design by the end of this module. I’m not aiming to be a professional in the field of Adobe XD and UI prototyping, but to be able to create a basic design, plan and UI layout. Understanding this process will help me plan future applications UI accurately and make the development process much easier and leave me with less roadblocks and issues that may arise from a lack of planning ahead.</p>	
					<p>I know I have achieved this goal set out when I am able to create and prototype my UI ideas inside Adobe XD without having to look at tutorials for help. It will also be a clear indicator that I have achieved what I set out to do when I refer to my Adobe XD designs with more details and functionality documented rather than my simple drawings and basic planning as before.</p>	 
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 8/Adobe-XD-free.jpg" alt=""></span>By following the tutorials and lessons provided by Adobe on XD I can achieve this goal within the time set out. In two weeks, I want to have a simple example of my UI completed in Adobe XD and make sure to continue to add to it as it grows in complexity. I want to have a basic UI layout completed in four weeks that I can follow to improve my UI prototype as it stands.</p>

					<h2><u>Week 9</u></h2>
					<h3><li>Sound Design Case Studies</li></h3>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 9/1_vzCPKrGqBtZ0NLeDb08X7Q.jpeg" alt=""></span>After reading the Articles Sprint Planning Meeting and Task Boards I created a new Trello board that focuses specifically on my sprints to help me keep track of what I want to achieve and how I want to do so. For my new sprints goal, I created a user story to keep me aligned with what I need to achieve while keeping the way I achieve the goal agile and flexible. My user story is as follows “As a user, I want to be able to see what my backyard would look like if it was covered in grass”. </p>
					<p>To accomplish this goal, I have created lists inside my new Sprint Trello board. These include Story, To Do, In Process, To Verify and Done. What I want to accomplish is to be able to take a floor area and detect its surface using my ARX project and have the user place grass on the area.  I want to achieve this goal within two weeks and have set aside three hours a week for my sprint. </p>
					<p>I want to achieve this goal as it will start the main functionality of changing surfaces and environments. This is the main functionality of my application and will provide me with a simple framework to build on and extend my library of surfaces and object that can be placed in the user’s surroundings.</p>
					<div align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gll5-kXyq58" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
					<p></p>	
					<p>I will know I have achieved my sprint goal when I am able to change a detected surface material to soil as well as place grass on top of the soil using a basic library UI on a physical device using my ARX application. This goal is achievable due to the past UI and surface detection sprints that I completed successfully in weeks six and seven. The UI sprint of week seven has made it simple for me to add new UI functions quickly and my surface detection sprint of week six gave me accurate surface detection and made it possible to place objects and change materials of the surface detection grid created when surfaces are detected in my ARX Application.</p>
					<p>I can commit to the three hours a week for two weeks as I will dedicate one and a half hours at the end of my day on Tuesdays and Thursdays to complete the sprint goal. Using my new Trello board for my sprint I will track my progress and time spent to assure I stay within the time, scope and in alignment with the user story I set out. </p>
					<p>Moving and completing cards in my To Do list will provide me with an indication of progress as I will move cards created from To Do into my In Process and finally on completion into Done Lists in Trello. Cards also have checklists assigned to them to help me plan my approach and see what needs to be done for the specific task set out.</p>
					<p>I have started my sprint during the planning phase that happened on Thursday 1st of August and will complete the goal by 11th of August. I have built UI library systems before and with the UI base I have completed in my earlier sprints, I will be able to quickly add new functionality and expand into a library containing materials and objects.</p>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 9/input_devices.png" alt=""></span>I know I can complete this quickly as I will keep it simple and only do one object and one material the user can place. I already have a ground material with textures and low poly mobile friendly grass that can be used in the sprint and have already set up my touch inputs to be able to instantiate objects on the surface of my grid created by my ARX application surface detection.I am very excited to start creating some simple inputs for the user to interact with the environment around them using my ARX application.</p>

					<h2><u>Week 10</u></h2>
					<h3><li>3D Asset Creation</li></h3>
					<p>After my Sprint goal of the past few weeks and setting everything up for my project management around Agile practices, I started doing my User Personas and found a big issue with my application. I don't believe it is very relevant in the industry and I am also not sure why I am developing it. The bigger picture is around designing your home and helping you better visualize your surroundings in a new way, but I feel my features that I have created doesn't really align very well with the bigger picture of my app.</p>
					<p>So, in the end I have decided to scrap my AR application. I have learned a lot about using Unreal in an AR environment and mobile development. I also discovered my lack of project management, UX/UI design and Market Research. These are obstacles I will need to overcome in the future to become a successful Creative App Developer. I will be righting about my obstacles in the and challenges in the upcoming Report on Continuing Personal and Professional Development as well as how I will overcome them.</p>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 10/effective-rapid-prototyping-diagram.jpg" alt=""></span>Moving forward I have decided to use Unity for my mobile development as I want to be able to rapid prototype and deploy to mobile for fast testing cycles [Reference 2]. Being able to deliver quick prototypes for testing will help my application chance of success in the long run as features developed can receive feedback quickly that can help me adjust what I am doing to keep the application on track with what my user wants instead of what I think would work [Reference 1].</p>
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 10/download.png" alt=""></span>Failing to receive feedback early in the development process will lead to long periods of time where features are developed with no real understanding of their relevancy and development that fluctuates very little with low contribute to knowledge flowing slowly between users and development teams [Reference 1]. This also leads to long cycles between getting new information of features required by users that would have been more relevant to the experience.</p>
					<p>To achieve this, I will need to understand the new features that has been introduced into Unity specifically around rapid prototyping. I will need to dedicate two hours a week to learn the new features that have been included in Unity 3D specific to rapid prototyping for mobile devices. I will know I have achieved this when I start to see features being prototyped successfully in a shorter amount of time during sprints and regular development leaving me with quick feedback from peers and users to improve my application. </p>

					<h3><li>Animation</li></h3>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 11/Persona.png" alt=""></span>I have started working on my C# development with Unity as well as Continuing with Adobe XD tutorials to understand how to create Personas for my applications. I have taken a lot of time the past week to analyze what App I really want to build moving forward with the Creative Application Development course. The  module has really made me think about app development in new ways and how to find and analyze what the bigger picture is around my app when it comes to solving real world problems and identifying if it is of value in the app markets available.</p>
					<p>I was building a flight simulator where you fly along with a pilot in a F15 fighter plane rather then fly yourself to help me learn the Job system in Unity using C#. I will be scraping the project after I am done with the Corsera course on Unity and move on to a passion project that I have been working on for the past five years. I haven't built anything yet, but the design has evolved from year to year.</p>	
					I want to build a Gladiator simulator, but with a twist. Instead of being the gladiator and fighting in the arena. You will take the place of a Lanista that own a Ludus (Gladiator school) and will provide the user with many ways to gain power in ancient Rome and gain the favor of the senate while rising to power. I will be building the app for the Gear VR on mobile using Unity as my engine of choice. I will also be using Autodesk Maya to build all my models and Gimp for my textures.</p> 
					<h3><li>I Am Spartacus!</li></h3>	
					<p>The bigger picture involved with this project is to give people the chance to feel what it felt like to be in control of human life in Ancient Rome and teach about the history, culture and suffering that occurred in the times due to slavery and violence that needlessly occurred to amuse the people of Rome, also known as the mob.</p>
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 11/5a5ebfafecc4734310735cf6ac14d9ae70af48eba8f1c39c85fead55f20f8766.jpg" alt=""></span>I want to have a basic prototype up and running where I can view some stadiums in mobile VR before the start of the next module in Creative Application Development course. I also want the project set up in trello and basic concept and ideas listed to build from. I also want to have my user profiles made so I can start planning sprint goals and development around my audience. I know I would have achieved this when I start to get more clear understanding of what I need to do and when a project development board has been set up in Trello, along with ideas and some basic models of stadiums that can be viewed within mobile VR.</p>
					<p>This will be achievable in the time set out due to the knowledge gained from the Individual Design and Development module and the insights gained into my strengths and weaknesses as indicated by next week's Report on Continuing Personal and Professional Development. I will be able to commit 10 hours a week as the Creative App Development course is on a break for 3 weeks, which gives me time in between my Corsera Unity course development and Adobe XD tutorials to complete my goals I have set out for myself.</p>

				<p>The bigger picture involved with this project is to give people the chance to feel what it felt like to be in control of human life in Ancient Rome and teach about the history, culture and suffering that occurred in the times due to slavery and violence that needlessly occurred to amuse the people of Rome, also known as the mob.</p>

I also want the project set up in trello and basic concept and ideas listed to build from. I also want to have my user profiles made so I can start planning sprint goals and development around my audience. I know I would have achieved this when I start to get more clear understanding of what I need to do and when a project development board has been set up in Trello, along with ideas and some basic models of stadiums that can be viewed within mobile VR.</p>
				<p>This will be achievable in the time set out due to the knowledge gained from the Individual Design and Development module and the insights gained into my strengths and weaknesses as indicated by next week's Report on Continuing Personal and Professional Development. I will be able to commit 10 hours a week as the Creative App Development course is on a break for 3 weeks, which gives me time in between my Corsera Unity course development and Adobe XD tutorials to complete my goals I have set out for myself.</p>
				
				<h3><li>Sprint Review</li></h3>
				<p><span class="image left"><img src="Individual Design and Development/Week 4/Images/Pathfinding.jpg" alt=""></span>Reflecting upon the App jam of week three I noticed that I did apply some of the practices involved in Agile development.  I found the practice of Extreme programming (XP) as I applied the planning game and simple design characteristics during my design phase and refactoring continuous integration along with coding standards in my development phase of the app jam. As issues in the application arose, I found myself using Pragmatic programming methods as thinking solutions instead of excuses, Fix bugs and issues as you see them, introducing change where you feel it is necessary to help me face the barriers ahead and overcome them.			
				<p>During the app jam I did practice Agile methods but didn't always focus on all the characteristics equally and didn't see how it all comes together. In my continuation of the app jam project across the study block I will apply Extreme programming core values when thinking about design and creating new features for my applications as it grows in complexity.
